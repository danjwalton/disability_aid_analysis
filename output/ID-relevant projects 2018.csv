PSI works broadly to assist health authorities in providing women and girls with modern contraceptives, information and education about SRHR, access to medicine, counselling and service regarding safe abortions. A clear focus is on poor young people, both in rural and urban areas.PSI is a registered nonprofit global health organization with programs targeting malaria, child survival, HIV, and reproductive health. PSI was founded in 1970 to improve reproductive health using commercial marketing strategies. PSI has its headquarters in Washington D.C. and programs in 69 countries. PSI normally works in partnership with the public and private sectors, and harnessing the power of the markets. At the same time, PSI works in partnership with local governments, ministries of health and local organizations. PSI provides life-saving products, clinical services and behavior change communications for the most vulnerable populations in the world.Access to contraception, lack of post-abortion care (PAC) and gender based violence (GBV) against women and girls are widespread issues in Zimbabwe that are aggravated further by the economic crisis. The challenges of the last years have increased the households' vulnerability, demolished social structures, and increased the risk of GBV against women and girls (such as sexual violence, forced marriage, child marriage, psychosocial and emotional violence) both domestically and outside the domestic sphere.Synergies will be sought with the Swedish regional support from our Embassy in Lusaka to PSI focusing on social marketing of contraceptives. PSI is with support from Sweden, starting a regional pharmaceutical enterprise with a targeted focus on developing pharmaceutical delivery channels to introduce commercially viable SRHR products. The products will include short-term and long-acting reversible contraceptives and other reproductive health and HIV products and services. The planned PSI enterprise has the potential to both address market gaps and deliver health impact.The main target group for the new Swedish strategy for development cooperaiton with Zimbabwe, is young people. This target group is particularly relevant when one in three young girls in Zimbabwe is subjected to sexual abuse before reaching the age of 16. Zimbabwe currently has one of the highest numbers of child marriage and GBV in southern Africa (more information in the Global Gender Gap Report and in Girls Not Brides Report).

Children, youth with disabilities, and girls are the special target groups. The Programme has 23 530 direct and 68 840 indirect beneficiaries. The activities are carried out in 6 different geographical areas that act either as a demo project for the other sites or in which a special set of barriers obstructing the fulfilment of childrens rights have been identified. The main problem in the society is the lack of knowledge on childrens rights for both rights holders and duty bearers. For this reason, civil society and authorities do not pay so much attention to the wellbeing and development of children. The Programme will be implemented by a Tanzanian partner, Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania which is a remarkable influence in the Tanzanian civil society. In addition to its approximately 800 000 members, FPCT has an extensive network of local and government actors within its realm of cooperation and influence. The Programme seeks to strengthen the advocacy roles of different civil society actors and FPCT regarding childrens rights. The Programme theme, right to health is addressed in different levels through a knowledge increase regarding nutrition and preventive health, care takers ability to respond to health challenges of children with disabilities, and sexual and reproductive health and rights. In the latter the Programme especially targets menstruation management, hygiene and psychosocial support for traumatized children. That the beneficiaries organize into civil society groups that promote the right to health is among the main activities. The theme right to education is addressed in the Programme through multiple activities: by empowering caretakers to realize childrens right to education, by providing support for better school performance and self-esteem development through childrens clubs, by sensitizing communities on the importance of education and strengthening participatory methods in education. Regarding the theme right to adequate standard of living, the activities include introducing initiatives that strengthen family livelihood, improved food security, improved living environment, and life and entrepreneurship skills especially among women and PWD. #The quality of the partners advocacy work is strengthened through developing platforms, where the voice of children with and without disabilities can be heard by the wider public.",Principal gender component,Significant disability component,Fida International ry,Donor country-based NGO,Mixed

The majority of refugees in Lebanon are concentrated in the North and in the Bekaa Valley which are characterised by already vulnerable communities and a waning sympathy from host communities.  Growing resentment on the part of Lebanese host communities and increasing frustration on the part of Syrian refugees is resulting in building tension. The aim of this project is to mitigate the negative impact of the Syrian crisis on refugee and host communities in Lebanon through youth empowerment. Youth in particular often fall through the cracks of humanitarian and other development programmes (which often target children under 12).  The project will improve livelihood prospects of young people through the provision of skills training appropriate to the context.  Further the project aims to strengthen a positive interaction between refugees and their hosts. This will take place through community bridge-building activities which will also act as a psycho social support.The livelihood trainings will be planned together with the beneficiaries in order to meet their actual needs. Learning and doing together best dispels tension and prejudice between groups. Also tension within the host community will be greatly reduced when livelihoods are created. The goal is that the host community will see the richness and added value of their new guests. Beneficiaries will be selected from the most vulnerable. The criteria used are their economic status gender disability and excluded status. The implementers are YMCA Finland and YMCA Lebanon. YMCAs headquarters are in Geneva and has close ties with UNHCR and other global actors. Activities are based on learning from previous interventions by the Lebanon YMCA and a needs assessment undertaken with young people in the target areas.

Description: Global mental health stands at an important juncture: recent research and policy reveals substantial challenges in closing the mental health treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries. However, worries persist that global mental health represents cultural colonisation by Western psychiatry/pharmacology, exacerbated further by the expansion of psychiatric genomics in African contexts. The project establishes a UK-Africa consortium which seeks to resolve dual ethical imperatives of addressing genuine challenges to mental health care in African settings alongside respect for African cultural thought and practice. The grant will enable: (i) a three-day workshop investigating (a) biomedical/non-biomedical explanatory models of mental disorder and recovery; (b) cultural conceptions of personhood and genetic identity; (ii) an international conference which explores African bioethical contributions to global mental health; (iii) knowledge exchange drop-ins which establish a deliberative forum for bottom-up learning; (iv) published outputs that (a) critically reflect on psychiatric classificatory models and the DSM-V Cultural Formulation interview; (b) the launch of a research and practical agenda for improving dialogue between biomedical and non-biomedical models of mental health. This will establish a collaborative programme of work devoted to future project proposals that advance cross-treatment dialogue and 'joined-up' thinking amongst practitioners and researchers of African mental health care.",No gender component,Significant disability component,Birkbeck University of London,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",Mixed

The majority of refugees in Lebanon are concentrated in the North and in the Bekaa Valley which are characterised by already vulnerable communities and a waning sympathy from host communities.  Growing resentment on the part of Lebanese host communities and increasing frustration on the part of Syrian refugees is resulting in building tension. The aim of this project is to mitigate the negative impact of the Syrian crisis on refugee and host communities in Lebanon through youth empowerment. Youth in particular often fall through the cracks of humanitarian and other development programmes (which often target children under 12).  The project will improve livelihood prospects of young people through the provision of skills training appropriate to the context.  Further the project aims to strengthen a positive interaction between refugees and their hosts. This will take place through community bridge-building activities which will also act as a psycho social support.The livelihood trainings will be planned together with the beneficiaries in order to meet their actual needs. Learning and doing together best dispels tension and prejudice between groups. Also tension within the host community will be greatly reduced when livelihoods are created. The goal is that the host community will see the richness and added value of their new guests. Beneficiaries will be selected from the most vulnerable. The criteria used are their economic status gender disability and excluded status. The implementers are YMCA Finland and YMCA Lebanon. YMCAs headquarters are in Geneva and has close ties with UNHCR and other global actors. Activities are based on learning from previous interventions by the Lebanon YMCA and a needs assessment undertaken with young people in the target areas.

We therefore now intend to promote conversations and increase awareness about what scientific research has shown about the nature of perinatal depression. We will first stage a play. This will be led by Dr Olajide in Nigeria together with local workers. We will then create a documentary of the performance and use this both online and in further meetings in different areas in Nigeria to encourage families, practitioners and policymakers to reflect on what research has shown about causes, effects and treatment.

Así, un niño que ve vulnerado su derecho a la alimentación, como consecuencia de la desnutrición, ve afectada su supervivencia y el desarrollo de su cuerpo y desus capacidades cognitivas e intelectuales, es decir, ve vulnerados otros de sus derechos.Guatemala ocupa el sexto lugar en el mundo en cuanto a prevalencia de desnutrición crónica en menores de 5 años (46.5%). El porcentaje se incrementa a 53% si viven en el área rural, 61% si es población indígena, 66% si es del quintil más pobre y 67% si la madre no tiene educación. La presente propuesta pretende contribuir al derecho humano a la alimentación a través de lareducción de los índices de desnutrición crónica en Guatemala y de la prevención de nuevos casos.La propuesta centrará la acción en 12 municipios de una de las regiones con mayor incidencia de la desnutrición crónica entre los titulares de derechos, la población menor de 5 años, esto es,Huehuetenango (67.7%).Se propone una estrategia integral que pretende mejorar la calidad de atención de los servicios de salud con una perspectiva culturalmente adaptada, con énfasis en la nutrición y el monitoreo del crecimiento, tomando como base a la comunidad y a través de metodologías participativas de comunicación para el desarrollo, impulsando la participación de los titulares de responsabilidades en la problemática y facilitando la sostenibilidad de las acciones.Incluye como elementos clave, la práctica adecuada de las acciones de la Estrategia de los 1.000 días (desde la concepción hasta los primeros 2 años de edad), la mejora de las prácticas de higiene y saneamiento y el establecimiento de espacios comunitarios de estimulación oportuna para menores de 5 años. La estrategia considera como punto central a la comunidad, con el objetivo de que las comunidades sean sujetos de su propia vida y no solo receptoras de las intervenciones.El programa se enmarca en la Estrategia Nacional de Prevención de la Desnutrición Crónica 2016-2020 del Gobierno de Guatemala y propiciará la coordinación interinstitucional y el empoderamientode las comunidades como agentes clave para la prevención y reducción de la desnutrición crónica en Huehuetenango. No es un proyecto aislado, sino que pretende expandir acciones que ya sevienen desarrollando en 11 de los 33 municipios de este departamento, todos priorizados por el gobierno en la Estrategia Nacional de Prevención de la Desnutrición Crónica (Ver Anexo1.

Este retardo según la edad es consecuencia de la desnutrición crónica, cuyos efectos a partir de los cinco años son irreversibles y suponen un evidente límite en el desarrollo físico (altura alcanzada), aunque también de las capacidadescognitivas. De esta forma, niñas y niños con desnutrición parten con menos recursos para desarrollar sus posibilidades futuras.La lógica de intervención descansa principalmente sobre el desarrollo de tres ejes:a) La apropiación de mujeres y hombres con hijas y hijos menores de 5 años de prácticasclave en SAN. Para eso, se desarrolla toda una estrategia de la consejería  domiciliar y grupal  para la adquisición de buenas prácticas  clave en higiene, salud y alimentación; a través de metodologíasparticipativas, horizontales y que parten del propio compromiso de las y los titulares de Responsabilidades(madres y padres).  b) El fortalecimiento de capacidades comunitarias en salud para la atención del riesgo reproductivo y enfermedades  prevalentes en la infancia. Esta estrategia se basa en el fortalecimiento de la pertinencia cultural de la atención en salud de las y de los titulares de derechos.c) El apoyo al sistema de salud institucional –en capacidades técnicas, insumos médicos, equipos e infraestructuras- para la implementación de los protocolos de atención según normativa de la OMS/ OPS, en especial en la salud  prenatal, el riesgo reproductivo y la vigilancia del crecimiento de niñas y niños hasta los cinco años.Todo eso con el objetivo de mejorar la salud y el estado nutricional de las mujeresembarazadas, niñas y niños  Q' anjob'al menores de cinco años de San Pedro Soloma.",Significant gender component,Significant disability component,Farmamundi,Donor country-based NGO,Other

El objetivo general de la intervención es contribuir a la mejora de la situación de salud de la población infantil saharaui de entre 3 y 6 años garantizando el correcto funcionamiento del programa de desayuno escolar al alumnado de las citadas guarderías. La problemática de los refugiados saharauis se remonta a hace más de 42 años, con la salida de España del territorio colonial y la anexión de este territorio por parte de Marruecos y Mauritania, lo que da inicio a una guerra entre el Frente POLISARIO y las dos potencias ocupantes. En el año 1991 se inicia un proceso de paz auspiciado por NN.UU. y que pone como condición la celebración de un referéndum para que el pueblo saharaui optara por continuar anexionado a Marruecos o por la autodeterminación. Este proceso se ha ido dilatando en el tiempo por los obstáculos puestos de manera continuada por el estado marroquí y por una falta de acuerdo entre las partes sobre el censo de votantes que participarían en el referéndum. Este estancamiento de la situación política ha llevado a que una gran parte de la población saharaui se vea confinada en los campamentos de refugiados de Tinduf, donde las condiciones de vida son especialmente duras. Los campamentos se encuentran situados en el sur de Argelia, en pleno desierto sahariano, en la conocida como Hammada, caracterizada por su ambiente árido y pedregoso, donde las temperaturas son extremas, llegando en el invierno a los 3º y en el verano a más de 50º. La escasez de agua y la aridez de la tierra hacen que sea muy difícil cualquier tipo de cultivo, por lo que la población depende de la ayuda humanitaria que distintas agencias internacionales distribuyen a las familias. La disminución de las ayudas internacionales que se ha producido en los últimos años ha redundado en una reducción considerable de los productos entregados. Actualmente la canasta básica aporta 2.000 Kcal/diarias por persona, lo que está por debajo de las 2.100 Kcal que recomienda la OMS para garantizar índices de nutrición adecuados. Ante esta situación se identifican determinados grupos de población en condiciones de especial vulnerabilidad en un contexto como el descrito, como es la población infantil, que con la actual cantidad de alimentos distribuida se ven abocados a una situación de desnutrición que afecta a su desarrollo físico e intelectual. Para paliar en la medida de lo posible esta situación, el proyecto pretende complementar la dieta que reciben los niños y niñas de entre 3 y 6 años con la distribución de alimentos de alto nivel calórico y equilibrio nutricional que aporten variedad en la dieta de los menores.

Description: Schizophrenia desperately needs new drugs. It affects 1% of adults, is a global health problem yet medications are only partially effective. They reduce psychotic symptoms but not negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, which are key factors for explaining illness-related disability. Schizophrenia and cognition are complex but highly heritable so genetics represents a vital tool for understanding neurobiology in the absence of biomarkers. A network of 150 coexpressed genes has been identified that is conserved throughout the human cortex. It is enriched for rare and common genetic variants associated with cognitive phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders. I plan to use the newest/largest available genetic studies of schizophrenia and cognition ( > 380,000 individuals) to study this gene network in these phenotypes. I will use gene-set analysis to test the network for enrichment of genes associated with schizophrenia or cognition. I will quantify the proportion of SNP-based heritability for schizophrenia or cognition that can be attributed to genes in this network. I will investigate what individual genes are associated with either phenotype or with both, i.e. genes that are having a pleiotropic effect. This can point to the biological processes that underlie cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and be a foundation for new methods of treatment. .
