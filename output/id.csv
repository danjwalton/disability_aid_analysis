Its geographic focus consists of 'hot spots' in Africa and Asia: semi-arid zones, mega-deltas and densely populated river basins (including glacier-fed systems). These hot spots combine two factors: significant impacts in the biophysical environment from climate change, and high risks to the livelihood of a large number of poor people with limited capacity to adapt.Using different socio-economic scenarios and climate warming scenarios, researchers will develop a better understanding of the conditions that make poor people vulnerable to climate change. As well, researchers will identify sustainable adaptation measures that can be promoted within and across the hot spots. Research findings will provide decision-makers at the local, national and regional levels with robust scientific evidence needed to policies and programs capable of increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to climate change.",No gender component,Not screened,International Development Research Centre,Donor Government,11000,Significant,No,potential false positive,Not inclusion,employment,intellectual,Not education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Employment,International Development Research Centre,Other channel,10000,Donor Government

The organization was established with the aim to gather and use the expertise of people who have gained knowledge and knowhow in different international education projects in the field of inclusive education implemented in Kosovo. Despite the support provided for inclusive education system in Kosovo the education system remains quite segregated. Most of the children with disabilities are attending in special schools/resource canters and attached classes. KAPIE staff has a long experience in the field of special needs and inclusive education and in other fields of education as well. Key staff members of KAPIE have worked as Advisors on inclusive education in International educational Projects such as: Finnish Projects- FSDEK II FSIESK and GIZ projectThere are no exact statistics about the number of children with special needs who are outside the school and there is an assumption that a great number of children with disabilities are not going to school at allKAPIE will work with 4 four model schools. At least one of the Model Schools will have RAE children. The Model Schools ? MS will be supported with intensive trainings on reading and writing difficulties and other trainings in the field of inclusive education such as TESFA (Basic training on Inclusive education)Schools will be supported in establishing support groups and in producing alternative learning materials to support their students in learning. With the support of the project MS will provide individual support for students experiencing reading and writing difficulties. Project in a close collaboration with MEST will work in developing further the idea of teaching based on activity areas. This is something new for Resource Centre staff and teachers form attached classes.Beneficiaries of the project will be four (4) primary mainstream schools students with disabilities and learning difficulties and Roma Ashkalinj and Egyptian  studentsThe overall objective of the project is to strengthen the support system and increase inclusion of children with disabilities and learning difficulties.,Significant gender component,Not screened,Embassy of Finland,Donor Government,11000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Embassy Of Finland,Other channel,10000,Donor Government

The organization?s aim is to gather and use the expertise of people who have gained knowledge and knowhow in different international education projects in the field of inclusive education implemented in Kosovo. KAPIE staff has a long experience in the field of special needs and inclusive education and in other fields of education as well. Key staff members of KAPIE have worked as Advisors on inclusive education in International educational Projects as Finnish Projects FSDEK II and FSIESK.Last year the Embassy supported KAPIE?s project ?Support to inclusive education reform?. The objective of the project was to strengthen the support system and increase inclusion of children with disabilities and learning difficulties. The support system for children with disabilities in Kosovo is weak and this project aimed at strengthening it. KAPIE has successfully managed the last year?s project so the Embassy has decided to continue the support for ?Support to Inclusive Education Reform 2015? with the same activities but widening them into 34 new primary schools. By doing so the number of students with disabilities in mainstream schools will be increased.,No gender component,Not screened,Embassy of Finland,Donor Government,11000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Embassy Of Finland,Other channel,10000,Donor Government

However poor quality and availability of teacher training together with limited resources for teaching and learning are affecting children's basic skills development namely literacy and numeracy skills. Especially teachers gaps in teaching reading in local languages are serious challenges that affect education quality and childrens illiteracy. The situation is most serious in Sub-Saharan Africa where more than 85% of children are not learning the minimum reading level until the end of primary education. There is a widespread agreement that the pre-service training and in-service professional development of teachers is a key component for improving childrens reading and success in life. The aim of this project is to enhance the capacities and pedagogical competences of the primary school teachers and special education teachers to teach and support reading and provide tools to improve literacy instruction of children at-risk for reading disabilities and children in general education. This continuation project is based on the preparation phase of eLearning teacher training programme for literacy learning and teaching in Sub-Saharan Africa (eTALE) financially supported by MFA as a disability project in 2015 and continued with funds carried over to 2016 (www.taleafrica.com). Through international African-Finnish teacher training collaboration we will provide pre-service and in-service training for teachers according to national and international policy strategies and goals of Unesco SDG. This will be achieved by developing and providing comprehensive free online professional development programme eTALE on literacy learning and teaching for teachers special education teachers teacher trainers and trainees and voluntary mentors for illiterate women to improve the quality of teaching reading skills and avoid illiteracy. This eTALE PD programme will be piloted in different contexts in Namibia (primary school teachers) Zambia (teachers of rural community schools) Kenya (special education teachers) and Tanzania (mentors for teaching illiterate women and teacher trainees).,Principal gender component,Principal disability component,Niilo Mäki-säätiö,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,Not inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Niilo Mäki-säätiö,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs. In addition the project will capacitate adults to support young people's life skills and participation. This will be done by training teachers CSO workers and activitists as well as organizing awareness raising events in the project implementation areas.,Significant gender component,No disability component,Suomen lasten ja nuorten säätiö,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Suomen Lasten Ja Nuorten Säätiö,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Project justification: #The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.#4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their childrens development.

It will work in two locations one in a poor Maputo suburban neighbourhood and the other in Marracuene district of the Maputo Province. It will attend and involve youth both in and out of school and it aims to reach in total around 8000 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs. In addition the project will capacitate adults to support young people's life skills and participation. This will be done by training teachers CSO workers and activitists as well as organizing awareness raising events in the project implementation areas.,Significant gender component,No disability component,Suomen lasten ja nuorten säätiö,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Suomen Lasten Ja Nuorten Säätiö,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

The other support provided is facilitation of formation of saving and loan groups  the project trains the group on principles of VSLA activity and donates a saving kit to each group formed. Both Business Skill and saving trainings are followed by mentoring and advisory services from the professional project staff. The beneficiaries are expected to enhance their ability to meet essential needs and to enjoy social and economic rights as part of their progress towards self-reliance.The general target group is refugees above 15 years old, who reside in Uganda in settlements or urban Kampala area, and their educational and skill level is in need of improvement. Special attention is put on the equal participation of women and youth. The target for women participants is 50% whereas target for people with special needs is 3 - 5% of beneficiaries. As recommended by OPM and UNHCR, the project will also target Ugandans living nearby settlements so that they are about 20%. As direct beneficiaries the 160 individual Business Skill Facilitators gain important skills and capacities in teaching and facilitation, and knowledge in business and livelihood related matters. They are trained to teach the 8-module course for the business learning group, and have a key role in implementing the project. Largest nationality group targeted will be South Sudanese in settlements in North Uganda, followed by refugees from DRC, Burundi, Rwanda and Somalia in settlements in South West Uganda. Majority of refugees arrive from villages with skills and experience related to agriculture and livestock rearing. However, at settlements their opportunities to practise agriculture are limited due to restricted access to land, farm inputs and markets.

Some 40-50 of the children have specific needs and the Family Guidance Centers have cooperation with 10 special schools. In the previous year all of them were showing good progress with one forth completing the treatment and 70% of the children withspecific needs showing good improvement. Social workers helped parents to findbetter ways to deal with and support their children (412 home visits). A special reason for continuing the project is that after 20 years the programstaff wants to update the service policy and develop a strategic plan. Therefore besides treatments and guidance the work history and actual working environments are reflected carefully. The staff collects their observations data andknowledge in order to develop a new model. They will  combine experience of client-centred work to the community oriented practice. It is not easy because the community and the children there are in turmoil. Through the collective effortto understand how to best shape the service the staff and administration will develop a strategic plan for mental health services. Best service for the most needy people is the motto of the mental health program of NISCVT. The strategic planning process addresses gender equality reducing inequality climate sustainability as well as questions of financial institutional social and ecological sustainabily. These are not new issues but placed in the new frame. NISCVT sees health as a human rights question issue.

Indeed, improper wiring of the nervous system has been suggested to be the basis for some neurodevelopmental defects. What are the mechanisms that guarantee the proper wiring between the billions of neurons during brain development? Axons are guided to their targets by molecules in the extracellular environment called 'guidance cues.' These cues can be either attractive, pulling axons in the right direction; or repulsive, preventing axons from navigating to incorrect targets. Other conditions in which axons need to navigate in adults are regeneration after mechanical or degenerative stimuli, as after spinal cord injury. Proper regeneration in adult mammals is still a significant clinical problem. Overall, this work will shed new light on the mechanisms that govern the wiring of the nervous system and their role in axon regeneration It could help to identify novel strategies to promote the proper guidance and wiring into neural circuits of abnormally developing axons or damaged and regenerating axons.The project is led in Canada by Frédéric Charron, Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) at the University of Montreal and his collaborators are Avraham Yaron, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, and Felipe A Court at University of Chile, Chile.This work is funded through the first research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Initiative.

In 2013-15 the focus has been on opening the way for Palestinian MSN children living in Lebanon and displaced from Syria to the special services. After a difficult start the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) of NISCVT have succeeded to obtain special education places in 16 institutions. A study on the MSN children (n=49) attending the special schools in 2013-2014 showed that clinically four of five children progressed at least moderately. Nearly all parents were satisfied and the schools stated that the children?s study motivation parents' involvement and children?s progress was good (75 %). In addition to the core activity the project has increased skills of the staff by training developed family-approach social work and encouraged the families to go out with their MSN child in order to get in contact with the community. Thus the project successfully mitigates disability-based discrimination. Services for boys and girls are equal although there are more boys than girls in the project due to the higher prevalence of disability rate in male than in female populations.Only a fraction of the Palestinian MSN children get rehabilitation and special education services in Lebanon and among the children displaced from Syria the situation is even worse. The project will continue mainly as in the previous years: FGCs offer assessment treatment referral to services additional treatments in FGCs and support to the families. The follow up project will focus more on initial rehabilitation assessment medical tests and medication. Places in special schools will be arranged for 60-80 MSN children (depending on the cost level). Activities with parents (100-160) and siblings (200-250) aim to make the daily environment of the MSN child more stimulating and encourage the family members to share the responsibilities for the care.The NISCVT FGSs will be developed by staff training service studies and the ?beneficiaries as project evaluators? model into resource centers that provide information and  support for working with the MSN children.,Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Finnish Psychologists for Social Reponsibility",Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"Finnish NGO, Finnish Psychologists For Social Reponsibility",DPO,20000,Donor country-based NGO

HI considère la pauvreté à la fois comme une cause et une conséquence du handicap. Pauvreté et handicap s'additionnent et augmentent la vulnérabilité et l'exclusion. La stratégie opérationnelle du programme se décline dans les secteurs dans lesquels HI a bâti une expérience solide :   Sécurité routière  Santé maternelle et infantile  Réadaptation à base communautaire  Réadaptation  Insertion professionnelle  Appui aux associations  - Specific objective:  La compréhension du handicap intellectuel sévère et profond, ainsi que les besoins de ce groupe, sont prise en compte dans la communauté.  Le projet vise à appuyer les familles de personnes handicapées, la communauté et les professionnels pour une meilleure compréhension des attitudes et difficultés que vivent les personnes avec handicap intellectuel et ll'isolement auquel sont soumises les familles, afin de favoriser à long terme un meilleure prise en charge de ces personnes et ainsi une plus grande autonomie et intégration sociale.  - Results:  Résultat 1: Les facteurs de risque des déficiences intellectuelles sont mieux connus et pris en compte par la population et par les services de santé de la province de Pinar del Rio. Pour parvenir à atteindre notre objectif, il est important que la population acquière une meilleure connaissance du handicap mais aussi des causes fondamentales liées à ce type de handicap (les facteurs périnataux sont une des causes principales du handicap intellectuel). Il est aussi nécessaire d'informer la population à travers des campagnes massives (spots télévisés/ brochures) mais aussi de préparer le personnel médical qui, centré sur la survie de la mère et du nouveau -né, ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences de certaines pratiques sur les conditions de vie de ces personnes dans le futur, ou minimise certains facteurs de risque. Résultat 2 Les services de diagnostic, orientation, et stimulation précoce ont des compétences actualisées sur la problématique liée à la déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde. Afin d'appuyer les familles à faire face à ce type de handicap, mais aussi permettre à l'enfant ou au jeune une évolution vers une plus grande autonomie, il est important de coordonner tous les efforts et les expertises existantes dans le pays, au service d'un programme d'appui aux parents au sein de leur communauté.

The programme responds to the situation through e.g. providing training and materials to teachers, raising awareness among the local communities and upgrading the physical facilities of special schools. Support to vocational training and micro enterprise formation are also central to the programme.

The program aims to raise awareness of the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities. Families living with  disabilities are supported and right to education is improved by inclusive education initiatives and classes run by community volunteers. The beneficiaries of the program are the disabled children, their families and community members.

En el primer proyecto (2012), se establecieron criterios para crear y consolidar la red de trabajo formada por centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones públicas. En 2013 sumamos la participación activa de dos ONGDs centroamericanas y centramos el trabajo en la defensa de los derechos de las mujeres. En 2014 (en ejecución) seguimos en la misma línea, pero transfiriendo el conocimiento de unos pueblos a otros que se sumaron al proceso. En 2015, tras valorar la incidencia que se está teniendo, seguimos profundizando con las organizaciones municipales en colaboración con dos asociaciones feministas centroamericanas: Mujeres Transformando (El Salvador) y La Cuerda (Guatemala); daremos continuidad al trabajo en los centros educativos que más se han implicado de los que se han sumado en el proyecto en ejecución, sin perder la continuidad con el centro de educación especial de Castro del Río; y se garantiza el uso de los espacios públicos necesarios contando con todas las bibliotecas como eje de transmisión de conocimiento. En este proyecto el objetivo es informar, comprometer y dotar de capacidad de movilización a la ciudadanía andaluza para detectar y enfrentar los micromachismos, trabajándolo específicamente, con centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones públicas municipales de Córdoba, Sevilla, Málaga y Jaén. El primer resultado se basa en consolidar la red de trabajo de centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones de ocho municipios andaluces y dos organizaciones feministas centroamericanas, para trabajar, generar sinergias e intercambiar experiencias. El segundo resultado se centra en el trabajo con los centros educativos mediante la ejecución de la nueva unidad didáctica que recoge las lecciones aprendidas en el proceso y propone un encuentro de los centros para intercambiar experiencias, evaluar y darle continuidad. El tercer resultado es fruto del trabajo realizado con los colectivos que avanzarán en la formación en género junto con las dos organizaciones centroamericanas, para ello se organizarán unas jornadas en las que planificaremos colectivamente el trabajo que luego realizaremos con cada colectivo para editar una herramienta audiovisual y realizar una campaña de incidencia en el municipio que desenmascare los micromachismos y defienda los derechos de las mujeres. El cuarto resultado se centra en fortalecer la capacidad de incidencia de centros educativos, colectivos y bibliotecas en Córdoba, Sevilla, Málaga y Jaén mediante la dotación de recursos: envío de materiales educativos, incorporación de artículos en la revista Pueblos sobre Centroamérica y África subsahariana; diseño, edición, publicación y muestra de una exposición fotográfica sobre los derechos de las mujeres en colaboración con La Cuerda; y participación en medios de comunicación.",Principal gender component,Not screened,,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,NA,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Most importantly, the aim is to increase the use of participatory and integrative teaching approach in teaching English, Geography and History. Additionally, themes such as environmental issues, social aspects of the hiv and aids -pandemia and gender equality will be holistically integrated in the mentioned subjects. Teachers' skills will be strengthened both in theoretical knowledge and practical training. Also research articles will be produced. During the recent years, secondary education in Tanzania has been characterised by a growing number of schools and students, and at the same time, by an alarming rate of failure in national Form 4 examinations. In the area of teaching approach, the Ministry of Education of Tanzania has introduced a curriculum change for secondary school subjects, including a shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered participatory approach. The introduction of new syllabuses has not been accompanied by adequate in-service training for the teachers working in the field. This has caused confusion, uncertainty and resistance among the teachers initially trained according to the principles of the traditional teacher-centered approach. PITA Project will be implemented in collaboration between TUMA University Faculty of Education, Meru District Education authorities and selected secondary schools. The project benefits the secondary school teachers and students but on top of that, it offers the academic programmes an opportunity to test and apply participatory and integrative teaching methods in practical grass root level teaching and to develop the teacher training programmes to meet the requirements and challenges of the Tanzanian reality.

In collaboration with our network of African literacy experts we aim to address this huge challenge of literacy learning and teaching to boost the development of primary education in Africa. In our project we focus on enhancing the primary school teachers? skills to teach reading in local African Bantu languages by developing a comprehensive step by step digital learning environment for teachers. The content of the eLearning environment will be created during the project together with the partner institutions.The teaching content will be developed during the alternating  phases of  trial and piloting phases over the course of 3 year project. The created materials will assist teachers to use effective methodology in literacy instruction in local Bantu languages which will enhance the children?s prospects of acquiring basic reading skills especially those children with special needs. Thus contributing to the improvement in teaching and learning outcomes. Finland is among the countries which have the highest literacy rates in the world. International research shows that the major factor behind this success is the nature of Finnish alphabetic system (transparent) and teaching method that is compatible with the regular orthography (there is only one way to spell a word or read a word). Nearly all Bantu languages in Africa have similar transparent alphabetic system to Finnish providing the opportunity to apply Finnish teaching methods and expertise at the time when the language policies and strategies have been revised so that mother tongue or local languages are used as a medium of literacy learning and instruction in primary schools. The project will support the children's right to quality education by boosting the teachers? skills in literacy teaching and the special needs children's opportunities for learning.,Principal gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Niilo Mäki Foundation",Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,Not inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"Finnish NGO, Niilo Mäki Foundation",Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Approximately 50% of children remain out of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend due to the lack of inclusiveness.  With support from Serve the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive & Child Friendly Education Policy in order to ensure access to and quality of education for all children regardless their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances.  The MoE has already begun trainings in Inclusive Education (IE) in several areas in Afghanistan including Nangahar province.SHIP school was established in 1991 to serve the educational needs of deaf children.  The school later expanded to educating children with intellectual disabilities and then recently in 2012 we began our reverse inclusion where the disabled and non-disabled children could be educated together in the same classroom. Many said this would not be possible. However SHIP has proven that it is possible. Serve s goal from its beginning has been to create inclusive communities.  We now believe the community is ready to begin handover of the SHIP school to the MoE as an example of inclusive education.  In order to make this a reality we will work with students parents community and other relevant stakeholders to begin advocacy with the government to take complete responsibility for the education of the students.  We believe this is possible because the government has already taken the responsibility for other special schools.  To accomplish the objective of SHIP handover the following steps will be taken:1. Preparation of MoE schools by implementing Serve Inclusive Education (IE) model2. Preparation of SHIP students for inclusion in the prepared inclusive MoE schools. 3. Preparation of SHIP teachers parents and community for the handover4. Ensure normal and smooth operation of SHIP during the transitional periodWe will gradually release responsibility to the government after they have been trained and equipped with the necessary skills and tools to provide sustainable and quality education for all students.

Significant number of learning difficulties or developmental problems are found in major part of the children. Required specialized rehabilitation services are scarce more often too expensive for the families. The cases are often multidisciplinary since the child has several problems. Large scale professional efforts are required the rehabilitation efforts are enormous. BAS initiated a Sponsorship Program in 2009 in order to provide special education and rehabilitation services for children in need. BAS covers the expenses for the children. The profound ethical guideline in the project: Children with special needs have the right for decent human development and protection regardless of their condition as well as being refugees.

Pour parvenir à atteindre notre objectif, il est important que la population acquière une meilleure connaissance du handicap mais aussi des causes fondamentales liées à ce type de handicap (les facteurs périnataux sont une des causes principales du handicap intellectuel). Il est aussi nécessaire d'informer la population à travers des campagnes massives (spots télévisés/ brochures) mais aussi de préparer le personnel médical qui, centré sur la survie de la mère et du nouveau -né, ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences de certaines pratiques sur les conditions de vie de ces personnes dans le futur, ou minimise certains facteurs de risque.Résultat 2 Les services de diagnostic, orientation, et stimulation précoce ont des compétences actualisées sur la problématique liée à la déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde.

There is a wide variety in the access and quality of services to the disabled children: even a town with 100 000 inhabitants is without any services. Environment is a new theme for the Kurds, littering nature and spending water in excess is common. About one million IDPs and Syrian refugees have entered Iraqi Kurdistan until September 2014. Especially Christian IDPs and refugees have seeked refuge in Ankawa, an Arab Christian suburb of Erbil. The partners of Fida are small local NGOs as well as governmental education offices in Sulaymaniyah Governorate. In Erbil Governorate, Fida partners with Assemblies of God Church, Ankawa. Fida trains school and kindergarten teachers in addressing children with special needs and applying child-centered education methods. Fida coaches the partners into good project administration as well as consideration of gender, children s rights and psycho-social needs. Fida supports the church in Ankawa in relief work and in planning a school for the refugee and IDP children.

They also work with local schools to build inclusive structures in order to support the participation of disabled children to primary education. Community volunteers are trained and motivated.  Consultation, medical aid and equipment are provided according to the needs and possibilities. The situation of persons with disabilities in the Lushoto district is poor; prejudices are common and there are no rehabilitation or educational opportunities for disabled children.

The program aims to raise awareness of the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities. Families living with  disabilities are supported and right to education is improved by inclusive education initiatives and classes run by community volunteers.

Reasons are lack of necessary knowhow and resources among municipal decision makers, parents of disabled children, teachers, and other local community influential people. Additionally, schools are often inaccessible and teachers lack skills to work with disabled children. Many disabled children thus are left without possibility of studying. Additionally in traditional culture children are often isolated from all social networks and their development is thus slowed or prevented. The traditional operating model is contrary to human rights and through this project traditional operating models are changed to realize human rights of disabled people. Expected development effects: realization of the human rights of disabled people in Lushoto province. Results of activities (i) community integration of rehabilitated disabled people, (ii) growth in skills of kindergarten and elementary school teachers to work with disbled children, and disabled children are able to attend school, (iii) improved health status of disabled children, and (iv) local leaders and civil servants are aware of Tanzanian disability legislation and implement the rights of disabled people in education. There are 2520 beneficiaries of the project (1045W ja 845M as carers of disabled children, including disabled youth and children 300G ja 330B) and 792 bearers of responsibility. 6860 individual benefit from the project indirectly. The target groups are disabled people, key individuals of organizations, and civil servants.

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers.

Project justification: #The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.#4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their childrens development. The project will also continue to expose and motivate the CBOs in East Jerusalem to participate in the Big Brother Big Sister programme.#5.

SABAQ ZARENDUK: POR EL DERECHO A LA EDUCACIÓN EN EL VALLE DE HUSHÉ :: El proyecto se va a llevar a cabo en diez escuelas de ocho poblados del valle de Hushe, distrito Ghanche, región de Baltistan, en la provincia del Gilgit-Baltistan, al norte de Pakistán.                                             El derecho a la educación no está garantizado en Baltistán. El elevado analfabetismo, el absentismo y abandono escolar temprano, su desigual distribución en función del género, la inexistencia de comunidad escolar y la ausencia de profesorado cualificado, disponible y motivado son los ejemplos más visibles de una oferta educativa escasa, discriminatoria y de mala calidad.                                                               Por ello el proyecto pretende extender y reforzar un nuevo modelo educativo en el Valle. Para ello se desarrollarán dos resultados con sus correspondientes actividades                         1. Fortalecimiento de la calidad de la educación asegurando la participación y el compromiso de los Comités de Educación y del profesorado en el Plan Educativo. Para ello se va a definir una política de igualdad de oportunidades a la hora de seleccionar al profesorado, se va a formar a dos profesoras en educación especial, se pagarán pluses económicos a 4 de los profesores y profesoras de mayor cualificación para garantizar su estabilidad en el proyecto, se construirán dos nuevas aulas para educación secundaria, se ofertarán 4 nuevas plazas para niños y niñas con discapacidad en un centro especializado, se ofertarán 6 becas dirigidas a mujeres para la realización de estudios superiores y se impartirán clases de refuerzo para la preparación de exámenes de acceso a estudios superiores.                                                         2.

El Plan de Desarrollo Comunal de Bni Idder considera el impulso de Enseñanza Primaria y la mejora de su calidad como eje prioritario de actuación. El 74.5% de su población es analfabeta (59.8% hombres y 89.2% mujeres). Por ello, presenta índices ligeramente superiores al resto del país y de los más altos de la Provincia de Tetuán. Bni Idder tiene 12 escuelas de Primaria Públicas (3 Agrupaciones escolares): Tlata Bni Idder (343 alumn@s y 14 docentes; 6 h y 8 m), Takat Amer (244 alumn@s y 10 docentes:2 h y 8 m) y Esbab (175 alumn@s y 10 docentes: 5 h y 5 m). Todas ellas carecen de infraestructuras básicas (la existente en estado lamentable); debido al descuido de las autoridades en su mantenimiento. Estas escuelas situadas en douares diseminados en  montaña; con acceso muy dificultoso, en época lluviosa.  Las escuelas están apartadas de las viviendas (de alumnado y profesorado). Por ejemplo, el personal docente de Tlata Bni Idder se desplaza, diariamente, desde Tetuán en taxi; debido a inexistencia de autobuses directos. Las familias del alumnado son campesinas; y en un 75-85% son analfabetas. Esta dispersión geográfica no favorece la organización del funcionamiento de las escuelas. En la Comuna, únicamente existe una Asociación de padres y madres creada recientemente por el actual director. En general, la población necesita sensibilización para impulsar el acceso y la continuidad escolar. Las carencias materiales, formativas, institucionales y sociales existentes provocan un desinterés y desmotivación en el personal docente. Con este proyecto, se pretende mejorar las capacidades humanas y el sistema educativo en la Primaria de l@s niñ@s de Bni Idder a través de acciones relacionadas con: a) construcción/rehabilitación y dotación de infraestructuras básicas a 3 Escuelas, b) talleres de Alfabetización y  sensibilización sobre la importancia de la educación para desarrollo integral, empoderamiento y el compromiso de las partes implicadas (Instituciones Educativas, Comuna, Directores y personal docente, padres/madres, menores, douares) para mejorar la calidad educativa en el medio rural (reducción absentismo y abandono escolar, calidad en los contenidos y nivel de enseñanza), c) talleres y reuniones para activar/dinamizar/fortalecer las asociaciones de padres y madres (AMPAS) que se  conviertan en garantes y defensores de los derechos de sus hijos a la educación especialmente al acceso con calidad de la misma.&quot;",Principal gender component,Not screened,"",Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"",Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Project: 11819 Big Brother Big Sister 2. Project area and Country: Occupied Palestinian Territory (East Jerusalem) 3. Project justification: The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.4. The main objective and the expected results: The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers' (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their children's development. The project will also continue to expose and motivate the CBOs in East Jerusalem to participate in the Big Brother Big Sister programme.5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 50 children from the marginalized neighborhoods in Jerusalem, 60 university student volunteers, parents of the targeted children, 200 children and 100 university students reached through community and promotional activities Duty bearers: Palestinian Ministry of Education, Directorate of Education in Jerusalem, local CBOs 6.

Health, General",Medical research,Circuit Formation by Spatio-Temporal Control of Messenger RNA Translation,CIRCUIT FORMATION BY SPATIO-TEMPORAL CONTROL OF MESSENGER RNA TRANSLATION,"The connections inside the brain need to be wired in a precise manner during development to ensure its proper function. This project will provide insight into circuit formation to help us understand how axon regeneration can improve clinical outcomes. Brain wiring, damage, and developmental defects Researchers have suggested that improper wiring of the nervous system is the basis for some neurodevelopmental defects. What are the mechanisms that guarantee the proper wiring between the billions of neurons during brain development? Molecules in the extracellular environment, called guidance cues, guide axons to their targets. These cues can be attractive, pulling axons in the right direction, or repulsive, which means they prevent axons from navigating to incorrect targets. Other conditions in which axons need to navigate in adults include regeneration after mechanical or degenerative stimuli, such as a spinal cord injury. Proper regeneration in adults is still a significant clinical problem. Project objectives This research project aims to: -generate a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the nervous system's wiring -identify novel strategies to promote the proper guidance and wiring of the nervous system -further develop the graduate training environment and international research collaboration among the partners This work will shed new light on the mechanisms that govern the wiring of the nervous system and their role in axon regeneration. It could help to identify novel strategies to promote proper guidance and wiring in the neural circuits of abnormally developing axons, or damaged and regenerating axons.

Some 40-50 of the children have specific needs and the Family Guidance Centers have cooperation with 10 special schools. In the previous year all of them were showing good progress with one forth completing the treatment and 70% of the children withspecific needs showing good improvement. Social workers helped parents to findbetter ways to deal with and support their children (412 home visits). A special reason for continuing the project is that after 20 years the programstaff wants to update the service policy and develop a strategic plan. Therefore besides treatments and guidance the work history and actual working environments are reflected carefully. The staff collects their observations data andknowledge in order to develop a new model. They will combine experience of client-centred work to the community oriented practice. It is not easy because the community and the children there are in turmoil. Through the collective effortto understand how to best shape the service the staff and administration will develop a strategic plan for mental health services. ?Best service for the most needy people? is the motto of the mental health program of NISCVT. The strategic planning process addresses gender equality reducing inequality climate sustainability as well as questions of financial institutional social and ecological sustainabily. These are not new issues but placed in the new frame. NISCVT sees health as a human rights question issue. This is the basis of the service from prevention promotion treatment and rehabilitation to how to help each child deal with their difficulties.,Significant gender component,Not screened,Finnish-Arab Friendship Society,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Finnish-arab Friendship Society,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers. Estimated number of children is 370-420 of them 60-80 children with special needs.,Significant gender component,Not screened,Psychologists for Social Responsibility,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Psychologists For Social Responsibility,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Approximately 50% of children remain out of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend due to the lack of inclusiveness. With support from Serve the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive & Child Friendly Education Policy in order to ensure access to and quality of education for all children regardless their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances. The MoE has already begun trainings in Inclusive Education (IE) in several areas in Afghanistan including Nangahar province.SHIP school was established in 1991 to serve the educational needs of deaf children. The school later expanded to educating children with intellectual disabilities and then recently in 2012 we began our reverse inclusion where the disabled and non-disabled children could be educated together in the same classroom. Many said this would not be possible. However SHIP has proven that it is possible. Serve's goal from its beginning has been to create inclusive communities. We now believe the community is ready to begin handover of the SHIP school to the MoE as an example of inclusive education. In order to make this a reality we will work with students parents community and other relevant stakeholders to begin advocacy with the government to take complete responsibility for the education of the students. We believe this is possible because the government has already taken the responsibility for other special schools. To accomplish the objective of SHIP handover the following steps will be taken:1. Preparation of MoE schools by implementing Serve Inclusive Education (IE) model2. Preparation of SHIP students for inclusion in the prepared inclusive MoE schools. 3. Preparation of SHIP teachers parents and community for the handover4. Ensure normal and smooth operation of SHIP during the transitional periodWe will gradually release responsibility to the government after they have been trained and equipped with the necessary skills and tools to provide sustainable and quality education for all students.

EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT OF TAKHYAMT, DAR CHERIF AND KHANDKIEN SCHOOL (BNI IDDER COMMUNE).","El proyecto se ha diseñado, participativamente, considerando prioridades del Gobierno Marroquí, consignadas en la Carta Nacional para la Educación y el Desarrollo y las Iniciativas Nacionales para Desarrollo; incluyen Planes Comunales de Desarrollo (PCD) ejecutados por Dirección General de Colectividades Locales del Ministerio del Interior (DGCL) en comunas priorizadas y seleccionadas atendiendo al índice de pobreza. El Plan de Desarrollo Comunal de Bni Idder considera el impulso de Enseñanza Primaria y la mejora de su calidad como eje prioritario de actuación. El 74.5% de su población es analfabeta (59.8% hombres y 89.2% mujeres). Por ello, presenta índices ligeramente superiores al resto del país y de los más altos de la Provincia de Tetuán. Bni Idder tiene 12 escuelas de Primaria Públicas (3 Agrupaciones escolares): Tlata Bni Idder (343 alumn@s y 14 docentes; 6 h y 8 m), Takat Amer (244 alumn@s y 10 docentes:2 h y 8 m) y Esbab (175 alumn@s y 10 docentes: 5 h y 5 m). Todas ellas carecen de infraestructuras básicas (la existente en estado lamentable); debido al descuido de las autoridades en su mantenimiento. Estas escuelas situadas en douares diseminados en  montaña; con acceso muy dificultoso, en época lluviosa.  Las escuelas están apartadas de las viviendas (de alumnado y profesorado). Por ejemplo, el personal docente de Tlata Bni Idder se desplaza, diariamente, desde Tetuán en taxi; debido a inexistencia de autobuses directos. Las familias del alumnado son campesinas; y en un 75-85% son analfabetas. Esta dispersión geográfica no favorece la organización del funcionamiento de las escuelas. En la Comuna, únicamente existe una Asociación de padres y madres creada recientemente por el actual director. En general, la población necesita sensibilización para impulsar el acceso y la continuidad escolar. Las carencias materiales, formativas, institucionales y sociales existentes provocan un desinterés y desmotivación en el personal docente. Con este proyecto, se pretende mejorar las capacidades humanas y el sistema educativo en la Primaria de l@s niñ@s de Bni Idder a través de acciones relacionadas con: a) construcción/rehabilitación y dotación de infraestructuras básicas a 3 Escuelas, b) talleres de Alfabetización y  sensibilización sobre la importancia de la educación para desarrollo integral, empoderamiento y el compromiso de las partes implicadas (Instituciones Educativas, Comuna, Directores y personal docente, padres/madres, menores, douares) para mejorar la calidad educativa en el medio rural (reducción absentismo y abandono escolar, calidad en los contenidos y nivel de enseñanza), c) talleres y reuniones para activar/dinamizar/fortalecer las asociaciones de padres y madres (AMPAS) que se  conviertan en garantes y defensores de los derechos de sus hijos a la educación especialmente al acceso con calidad de la misma.",Principal gender component,Not screened,"",Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"",Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

This project will provide insight into circuit formation to help us understand how axon regeneration can improve clinical outcomes. Brain wiring, damage, and developmental defects Researchers have suggested that improper wiring of the nervous system is the basis for some neurodevelopmental defects. What are the mechanisms that guarantee the proper wiring between the billions of neurons during brain development? Molecules in the extracellular environment, called guidance cues, guide axons to their targets. These cues can be attractive, pulling axons in the right direction, or repulsive, which means they prevent axons from navigating to incorrect targets. Other conditions in which axons need to navigate in adults include regeneration after mechanical or degenerative stimuli, such as a spinal cord injury. Proper regeneration in adults is still a significant clinical problem. Project objectives This research project aims to: -generate a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the nervous system's wiring -identify novel strategies to promote the proper guidance and wiring of the nervous system -further develop the graduate training environment and international research collaboration among the partners This work will shed new light on the mechanisms that govern the wiring of the nervous system and their role in axon regeneration. It could help to identify novel strategies to promote proper guidance and wiring in the neural circuits of abnormally developing axons, or damaged and regenerating axons.

Project wants to highlight the child's right to get quality mental health service when in need due to some mental health behavior or developmental disturbance. This is done in partnership with Beddawi and Nahr el-Bared Family Guidance Centers (FGC) of Beit Atfal Assumoud. According to the parents children in previous phase of the project have gained Improved language/communication skills autonomy and self-confidence cognitive and motor progress reading and writing skills daily living skills social skills and less distracted and more attentive behavior.The continuation of the project is based on the notion that especially concerning the children with multiple disabilities time and patience is needed in their treatment setting. The child with disabilities needs a lot of rehearsal and repetition before he/she has learned the new skill permanently. The result in the project is the children's better wellbeing and new skills gained in treament and special education. In cooperation with family and duty bearers right to quality service will come up. Cross-cutting objectives are challenged in all activities especially children's own reactions to the serious principles will be listened. Also in all documents the principles are analysed in connection the activities. The inequality and discrimination is present in the Palestinian children's lives.

Lebanon has launched the Crisis Response Plan to find the stabilizing ingredients in every action. The project Developing the children's mental health and special services in ongoing crisis responds to the long-term problem the marginalisation of Palestinian refugees in host country and the hardships of the poor families. Normal services are not only actual service but recognition to the right to exist to enjoy the civil rights to gain resources for decent life. Annually hundreds of Palestinian children have got high quality help and families relieved when seeing the progress of the child. BAS proceeded to take seriously the right to education of the children with intellectual and psychological disabilities. Because of the staff's negotiations with special schools small number of institutions offering places for Palestinian children has already increased to almost 40. It is a break through: Palestinian children with disabilities are visible now. In all actions the sustainability was respected in human environment and ecologically. Concerning gender boys were major beneficiaries but the prevalence of disability of boys in young age is more than of girls. The main partner is Finnish Arab Friendship Society which works also to support the families by sponsorship program and for children's mental health. FiPSR works in South Lebanon FAFS in North Lebanon. There are 5 partners of BAS with whom Finnish NGOs are in continuous contact. The beneficiaries are 260 children with disturbancies in mental health behavior and development new referrals to the Family Guidance Centers and ca 400 children who continue in treatment. The formerly separate disability project which was pioneer in its field is now included in the new project. 60 children with multiple special needs (disabilities) will benefit from special education and rehabilitation.

Pauvreté et handicap s'additionnent et augmentent la vulnérabilité et l'exclusion.La stratégie opérationnelle du programme se décline dans les secteurs dans lesquels HI a bâti une expérience solide : Sécurité routièreSanté maternelle et infantileRéadaptation à base communautaireRéadaptationInsertion professionnelleAppui aux associationsSPECIFIC RESULTS:  Résultat 1: Les facteurs de risque des déficiences intellectuelles sont mieux connus et pris en compte par la population et par les services de santé de la province de Pinar del Rio. Pour parvenir à atteindre notre objectif, il est important que la population acquière une meilleure connaissance du handicap mais aussi des causes fondamentales liées à ce type de handicap (les facteurs périnataux sont une des causes principales du handicap intellectuel). Il est aussi nécessaire d'informer la population à travers des campagnes massives (spots télévisés/ brochures) mais aussi de préparer le personnel médical qui, centré sur la survie de la mère et du nouveau-né, ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences de certaines pratiques sur les conditions de vie de ces personnes dans le futur, ou minimise certains facteurs de risque.Résultat 2 Les services de diagnostic, orientation, et stimulation précoce ont des compétences actualisées sur la problématique liée à la déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde. Afin d'appuyer les familles à faire face à ce type de handicap, mais aussi permettre à l'enfant ou au jeune une évolution vers une plus grande autonomie, il est important de coordonner tous les efforts et les expertises existantes dans le pays, au service d'un programme d'appui aux parents au sein de leur communauté. C'est pourquoi il est prévu de créer un groupe opérationnel multisectoriel au niveau provincial, qui s'appuiera sur un groupe municipal. Ce groupe intégré par des professionnels pourra alors promouvoir la détection et la stimulation précoce pour agir le plus vite possible, mais aussi renforcer le diagnostic psychopédagogique afin qu'il soit fait de façon plus intégral et précis. Le projet s'appuiera également sur le réseau d'agents communautaires existants, crée dans la cadre du projet RBC précédent, pour le renforcer, afin qu'ils puissent guider les parents dans ce processus de réadaptation.Résultat 3 : Les familles d'enfants et adolescents vivant avec une déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde sont mieux préparées pour favoriser l'autonomie et/ou améliorer leur qualité de vie. Le projet prétend mettre en place un programme intégral, avec des outils à destination des familles (et donc adapté à leur contexte culturel), qui doivent les aider à accompagner la personne de leur famille avec handicap intellectuel dans son évolution vers une plus grande autonomie et une meilleure intégration sociale. Les plans de suivi mis en place pour la réadaptation des personnes tiendront compte du contexte et des besoins individualités de chacun et permettront une stimulation des aptitudes de base.

Esto como estrategia para reunir todo lo referente al trabajo con comunidades vulnerables en Bogotá, siendo parte muy importante de ello. El Hogar Santa María de los Robles está ubicado en el barrio Caracolí,  al sur de la ciudad de Bogotá, en Colombia. El Hogar tuvo su origen en el año 2003, a partir de las visitas realizadas por ?Religiosas Esclavas del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús? y el acompañamiento de personas voluntarias, al barrio Caracolí, hechas a familias con miembros en condición de discapacidad física, cognitiva, social y mental. En estas visitas se detectaron las condiciones de vida de las familias, así como factores de vulnerabilidad: salud, educación, vivienda y socio-culturales a las que se veían expuestas.

The overall aim is to promote school achievement possibilities of further education and future good quality of life. The specific aims are to promote inclusion of children with disabilities in the schools (they are less than 1%) to promote reading and writing abilities and prevent difficulties and to decrease the high drop-out rate. In addition the aim is to develop the curriculums for teacher education and for certain school subjects (mathematics and environmental education). In curriculum development an important area is curriculum adaptation for children with disabilities. Workshops/seminars will be arranged in two places (Dar es Salaam and Moshi) three days/place during three years (in total18 days) for key persons/stakeholders in the educational sector (school inspectors district educational officers tutors principals etc.).  The topics are To promote reading and writing abilities Inclusive education for children with disabilities and Professional and Curriculum development. Lecturers in the seminars are tanzanian PhD-holders in Special education and Education graduated from Åbo Akademi university in Finland. The lecturers are specialists in their fields and they have conducted large research projects in Tanzania. Thus they have a good knowledge about the local needs and problems. The participants (40 in each seminar) are expected to plan carry out evaluate and report development projects in their own areas in the local communities. The results and models of best practices are suggested to be implemented in the whole country and lead to sustainability which is the overall aim of the project.,Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, U-landsföreningen i Vasa r.f.",Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"Finnish NGO, U-landsföreningen I Vasa R.f.",Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Most importantly, the aim is to increase the use of participatory and integrative teaching approach in teaching English, Geography and History. Additionally, themes such as environmental issues, social aspects of the hiv and aids -pandemia and gender equality will be holistically integrated in the mentioned subjects. Teachers' skills will be strengthened both in theoretical knowledge and practical training. Also research articles will be produced. During the recent years, secondary education in Tanzania has been characterised by a growing number of schools and students, and at the same time, by an alarming rate of failure in national Form 4 examinations. In the area of teaching approach, the Ministry of Education of Tanzania has introduced a curriculum change for secondary school subjects, including a shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered participatory approach. The introduction of new syllabuses has not been accompanied by adequate in-service training for the teachers working in the field. This has caused confusion, uncertainty and resistance among the teachers initially trained according to the principles of the traditional teacher-centered approach. PITA Project will be implemented in collaboration between TUMA University Faculty of Education, Meru District Education authorities and selected secondary schools. The project benefits the secondary school teachers and students but on top of that, it offers the academic programmes an opportunity to test and apply participatory and integrative teaching methods in practical grass root level teaching and to develop the teacher training programmes to meet the requirements and challenges of the Tanzanian reality. In 2014 a background survey was conducted and 20 econdary schools with approximately 4.200 students and 120 teachers chosen to the project.Menetelmänä on järjestää koulutusseminaareja ja käytännön työpajoja yliopistolla sen henkilökunnalle sekä projektikoulujen opettajille.

Approximately 50% of children remain out of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend due to the lack of inclusiveness.  With support from Serve the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive & Child Friendly Education Policy in order to ensure access to and quality of education for all children regardless their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances.  The MoE has already begun trainings in Inclusive Education (IE) in several areas in Afghanistan including Nangahar province.SHIP school was established in 1991 to serve the educational needs of deaf children.  The school later expanded to educating children with intellectual disabilities and then recently in 2012 we began our reverse inclusion where the disabled and non-disabled children could be educated together in the same classroom. Many said this would not be possible. However SHIP has proven that it is possible. Serve s goal from its beginning has been to create inclusive communities.  We now believe the community is ready to begin handover of the SHIP school to the MoE as an example of inclusive education.  In order to make this a reality we will work with students parents community and other relevant stakeholders to begin advocacy with the government to take complete responsibility for the education of the students.  We believe this is possible because the government has already taken the responsibility for other special schools.  To accomplish the objective of SHIP handover the following steps will be taken:1. Preparation of MoE schools by implementing Serve Inclusive Education (IE) model2. Preparation of SHIP students for inclusion in the prepared inclusive MoE schools. 3. Preparation of SHIP teachers parents and community for the handover4. Ensure normal and smooth operation of SHIP during the transitional periodWe will gradually release responsibility to the government after they have been trained and equipped with the necessary skills and tools to provide sustainable and quality education for all students. After the handover Serve will continue to follow-up and support the inclusive MoE schools through the CBR (Community-based Rehabilitation) function of SHIP capacity of which will be increased to support increased number of clients.,Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Operaatio Mobilisaatio ry",Donor country-based NGO,22000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"Finnish NGO, Operaatio Mobilisaatio Ry",Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Todas ellas carecen de infraestructuras básicas (la existente en estado lamentable); debido al descuido de las autoridades en su mantenimiento. Estas escuelas situadas en douares diseminados en montaña; con acceso muy dificultoso, en época lluviosa. Las escuelas están apartadas de las viviendas (de alumnado y profesorado). Por ejemplo, el personal docente de Tlata Bni Idder se desplaza, diariamente, desde Tetuán en taxi; debido a inexistencia de autobuses directos. Las familias del alumnado son campesinas; y en un 75-85% son analfabetas. Esta dispersión geográfica no favorece la organización del funcionamiento de las escuelas. En la Comuna, únicamente existe una Asociación de padres y madres creada recientemente por el actual director. En general, la población necesita sensibilización para impulsar el acceso y la continuidad escolar. Las carencias materiales, formativas, institucionales y sociales existentes provocan un desinterés y desmotivación en el personal docente.

Government & Civil Society-general,Human rights,INT/UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons With Disabilities UNPRPD,INT/UN PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES UNPRPD,It is estimated that more than a billion people - about 15 % of the world s population - live with some form of disability. They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO s have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is  also  member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.  Finland  has channelled 6.060.000 million euros to the partnership  (2012-2015).

Description: SANTHE will have acted to make our annual consortium meeting, a crucial scientific and networking meeting, more diverse and inclusive by supporting parents who require specific child-associated assistance to attend. Help will have consisted of covering flight, local transportation, housing and meal costs for children and nannies, and also on-site childcare. Our first-hand observations and experience have highlighted the difficulty some individuals in our network, particularly mothers, have in attending international meetings. This has been particularly obvious for our annual consortium meeting where a number of our scientists were unable to attend in 2016 (Kenya) and 2017 (Botswana) due to reasons that included breastfeeding an under 6 month old, no other child-support at home, and the inability to leave behind an autistic child for long periods. Our work-life panel discussion that took place at the SANTHE South Africa Site Meeting in June 2018 further highlighted the difficulties faced. SANTHE will have worked to address some of these diversity and inclusion issues by supporting certain scientists in our network to attend our 2018, 2019 and 2020 annual consortium meeting with their children. We anticipate that a total number of 11-15 scientists will have benefited from this assistance. We will have assessed the perceived impact of attending the meeting for the selected individuals, and the quality and practicality of on-site child-care support. Hopefully, this preliminary data will be used to apply for additional funds to support our parent-scientists attending additional international scientific meetings in the future, assisting their scientific career progression.",Significant gender component,No disability component,Africa Health Research Institute,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,Not education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Family,Africa Health Research Institute,Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

Description: Schizophrenia desperately needs new drugs. It affects 1% of adults, is a global health problem yet medications are only partially effective. They reduce psychotic symptoms but not negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, which are key factors for explaining illness-related disability. Schizophrenia and cognition are complex but highly heritable so genetics represents a vital tool for understanding neurobiology in the absence of biomarkers. A network of 150 coexpressed genes has been identified that is conserved throughout the human cortex. It is enriched for rare and common genetic variants associated with cognitive phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders. I plan to use the newest/largest available genetic studies of schizophrenia and cognition ( > 380,000 individuals) to study this gene network in these phenotypes. I will use gene-set analysis to test the network for enrichment of genes associated with schizophrenia or cognition. I will quantify the proportion of SNP-based heritability for schizophrenia or cognition that can be attributed to genes in this network. I will investigate what individual genes are associated with either phenotype or with both, i.e. genes that are having a pleiotropic effect.

Description: Global mental health stands at an important juncture: recent research and policy reveals substantial challenges in closing the mental health treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries. However, worries persist that global mental health represents cultural colonisation by Western psychiatry/pharmacology, exacerbated further by the expansion of psychiatric genomics in African contexts. The project establishes a UK-Africa consortium which seeks to resolve dual ethical imperatives of addressing genuine challenges to mental health care in African settings alongside respect for African cultural thought and practice. The grant will enable: (i) a three-day workshop investigating (a) biomedical/non-biomedical explanatory models of mental disorder and recovery; (b) cultural conceptions of personhood and genetic identity; (ii) an international conference which explores African bioethical contributions to global mental health; (iii) knowledge exchange drop-ins which establish a deliberative forum for bottom-up learning; (iv) published outputs that (a) critically reflect on psychiatric classificatory models and the DSM-V Cultural Formulation interview; (b) the launch of a research and practical agenda for improving dialogue between biomedical and non-biomedical models of mental health. This will establish a collaborative programme of work devoted to future project proposals that advance cross-treatment dialogue and 'joined-up' thinking amongst practitioners and researchers of African mental health care.",No gender component,Significant disability component,Birkbeck University of London,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Principal,Yes,No,Not inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Birkbeck University Of London,Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

Population Policies/Programmes & Reproductive Health,STD control including HIV/AIDS,Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence (SANTHE),SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN NETWORK FOR TB/HIV RESEARCH EXCELLENCE (SANTHE),"Programme: Research Enrichment - Diversity and Inclusion. Description: SANTHE will have acted to make our annual consortium meeting, a crucial scientific and networking meeting, more diverse and inclusive by supporting parents who require specific child-associated assistance to attend. Help will have consisted of covering flight, local transportation, housing and meal costs for children and nannies, and also on-site childcare. Our first-hand observations and experience have highlighted the difficulty some individuals in our network, particularly mothers, have in attending international meetings. This has been particularly obvious for our annual consortium meeting where a number of our scientists were unable to attend in 2016 (Kenya) and 2017 (Botswana) due to reasons that included breastfeeding an under 6 month old, no other child-support at home, and the inability to leave behind an autistic child for long periods. Our work-life panel discussion that took place at the SANTHE South Africa Site Meeting in June 2018 further highlighted the difficulties faced. SANTHE will have worked to address some of these diversity and inclusion issues by supporting certain scientists in our network to attend our 2018, 2019 and 2020 annual consortium meeting with their children. We anticipate that a total number of 11-15 scientists will have benefited from this assistance. We will have assessed the perceived impact of attending the meeting for the selected individuals, and the quality and practicality of on-site child-care support. Hopefully, this preliminary data will be used to apply for additional funds to support our parent-scientists attending additional international scientific meetings in the future, assisting their scientific career progression.",Significant gender component,No disability component,Africa Health Research Institute,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,Not education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Family,Africa Health Research Institute,Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

Health, General",Medical research,The Effect of Antibiotics in Early Life on Brain Function and Behaviour,THE EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTICS IN EARLY LIFE ON BRAIN FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOUR,"The human gastrointestinal tract is home to 100 trillion microorganisms. Research has found that these microorganisms, known as gut microbiota, play an important role in the development and normal function of our immune and nervous systems. This project will offer important insights into how antibiotics might disrupt gut microbiota and affect brain function in young children.Brain chemistry and antibioticsRecent evidence in animal models suggests that gut microbiota can influence brain chemistry, which can affect behaviour. However, we do not know how this occurs. We also do not know how the disruption of normal gut microbiota early in life from antibiotic use, for example, might influence brain development and potentially contribute to behavioural and/or mood disorders. This project will seek to offer some answers. The research team will aim to:-understand the mechanisms underpinning the microbiome-gut-brain axis and the potential contribution of gut microbiota disruption to neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders-determine the long-term impact of early life disruption of the gut microbiota on brain chemistry and behaviour related to anxiety and social interaction-delineate immune mechanisms linking the altered microbiota to behavioural changes-identify potentially novel components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis related to antibiotic effects on brain function and behaviour-further develop the training environment and collaborative research among the partnersUnderstanding the gut-brain linkThe successful completion of this project will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the connection between gut bacteria and the brain. It will provide insight into the gut microbiota disruption's potential contribution to the development of mood and behavioural disorders.

Project: A community approach to accelerate the discovery of the molecular basis of neurodevelopmental disorders . Grantee location: UK. Description: The molecular causes of the majority of inherited neurodevelopmental disorders remains largely poorly understood, presenting an immense healthcare burden worldwide. The cause of such disorders in rural Pakistan typically relates to founder mutations that have accumulated due to historical ancestral population bottlenecks, followed by population expansion. Together with expert clinical input, this enables greatly empowered phenotypical, genetic and functional studies to discover the molecular causes of autosomal recessive diseases that would otherwise elude discovery, benefiting medical science and aiding disease diagnosis globally. This seed proposal will cement new collaborative relationships established by the applicant and develop infrastructure in four Pakistani Research Centres enabling invaluable new opportunities for novel neurodevelopmental disease gene discoveries. These will unravel important new biomolecular developmental processes for future exploration using stem cell and animal models that will be developed alongside this program. This project also provides opportunities to improve local knowledge of the spectrum and causes of inherited neurodevelopmental disease, greatly facilitating development of diagnostic services in Pakistan. By consolidating these collaborative relationships, while further developing the applicant's skill set and experience, the proposal will lay foundations for long term future molecular studies to enhance scientific knowledge and define new therapeutic avenues for these devastating disorders.",No gender component,Not screened,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank","University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,"University, College Or Other Teaching Institution, Research Institute Or Think-tank",Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

Project: Investigating the influence of vitamin D status on cognitive and motor development in young African children.. Grantee location: Kenya. Description: Poor child development is a major public health concern in Africa where children are exposed to risk factors such as poverty and malnutrition. Studies show that vitamin D deficiency affects African children despite sunshine throughout the year. Evidence from in vitro and animal work shows that vitamin D plays an important functional role in neurodevelopment. There is limited literature on the effects of vitamin D deficiency on child development especially in African populations and these have shown mixed results. I intend to carry out an observational study among 1583 children to establish if there is an association between vitamin D status and cognitive and motor development. Additionally, in a pilot study I will use genetic variation in vitamin D to investigate causality between low vitamin D levels and impaired development among 2583 children. This approach reflects life-long exposure and avoids the potential problems of confounding and reverse causation associated with observational studies. A significant advantage is that, through collaboration, vitamin D measurements, developmental scores and genome wide association study (GWAS) data are already available for the majority of these children. This study will inform the design of interventions to prevent vitamin D deficiency/ insufficiency and improve child development in Africa.",No gender component,Not screened,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank","University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,Not inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,Not education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Other,"University, College Or Other Teaching Institution, Research Institute Or Think-tank",Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

Project: The Adaptation and Validation of a Measure to Monitor HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders in Adults Aging With HIV in SSA. Grantee location: Kenya. Description: The neurological complications of HIV e.g. cognitive deficits, have remained a great source of morbidity, significantly decreasing the quality of life among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Such complications remain prevalent, affecting as many as 70% of PLHIV, including those on HAART. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the problem remains largely undocumented in SSA.This can partly be attributed to the acute shortage of trained personnel and health care providers in the region, thus challenging the regular screening of HAND. Moreover, there are hardly any validated tools for screening and diagnosing  HAND.I therefore plan to develop and validate a context relevant screening measure of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders among adults living with HIV in SSA using a 4-step approach to tool development and adaptation. These are construct clarification, item development, scale development and evaluation. 300 adults will take part in this study. I intend to use a mixed method approach (FGDs, in-depth interviews) and quantitative methods.  For qualitative data, thematic analysis using NVIVO will be carried out. The adapted tool would then be evaluated using standard psychometric tests including reliability and validity measures as well as diagnostic accuracy examining sensitivity and specificity.",No gender component,Not screened,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank","University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,Not inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,Not education,Not family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Other,"University, College Or Other Teaching Institution, Research Institute Or Think-tank",Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

The insect models are simple to perform (peeling a shrimp), cost efficient, but still unique in its complexity (readout of a metabolically active whole brain). The equipment is readily accessible and require low maintenance; smart phone, insects, and fluorescent small molecules. According to the Global Alliance of Health and Pollution, pollution, not disease, is the biggest killer in the developing world, taking more lives each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS. While adverse effects of pollutions are mainly studied by looking at the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, effects on the central nervous system (CNS) are not broadly recognized. However, in recent studies, pollution has been associated with variety diseases of the CNS, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The insect models will allow more cost efficient access to toxicity profiling and thereby potentially increase the number of tests performed.

Neurodevelopmental disorders have previously been neglected due to more challenging health problems, e.g., under 5 mortality. However, CP is a common cause of movement disability and it has a devastating impact on the child and its family affecting occupational activities, social relationships, psychological well-being and financial conditions. We plan to perform a randomized controlled study comparing clusters of villages with the community based program to villages maintaining the ordinary health services. However, before commencing the intervention we need to understand the panorama of CP in Uganda. There is little information available about the epidemiology of CP in Sub-Saharan Africa. We are currently studying a hospital cohort at Mulago University Hospital in Kampala, but there are obvious limitations. Therefore, we plan to perform a population-based epidemiology study on CP at the Iganga DSS, in which we will explore the prevalence, type of CP, severity level, associated risk factors as well as available rehabilitative and therapeutic services. The subsequent intervention study will be performed on this cohort of children. The information and the results from this project will be useful for advocacy purposes and aiding policy makers allocate adequate resources for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities.",No gender component,Not screened,Karolinska Institutet,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Karolinska Institutet,Other channel,50000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or thinkâtank"

Health, General",Medical research,The Effect of Antibiotics in Early Life on Brain Function and Behaviour,THE EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTICS IN EARLY LIFE ON BRAIN FUNCTION AND BEHAVIOUR,"The human gastrointestinal tract is home to 100 trillion microorganisms. Research has found that these microorganisms, known as gut microbiota, play an important role in the development and normal function of our immune and nervous systems. This project will offer important insights into how antibiotics might disrupt gut microbiota and affect brain function in young children.Brain chemistry and antibioticsRecent evidence in animal models suggests that gut microbiota can influence brain chemistry, which can affect behaviour. However, we do not know how this occurs. We also do not know how the disruption of normal gut microbiota early in life from antibiotic use, for example, might influence brain development and potentially contribute to behavioural and/or mood disorders. This project will seek to offer some answers. The research team will aim to:-understand the mechanisms underpinning the microbiome-gut-brain axis and the potential contribution of gut microbiota disruption to neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders-determine the long-term impact of early life disruption of the gut microbiota on brain chemistry and behaviour related to anxiety and social interaction-delineate immune mechanisms linking the altered microbiota to behavioural changes-identify potentially novel components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis related to antibiotic effects on brain function and behaviour-further develop the training environment and collaborative research among the partnersUnderstanding the gut-brain linkThe successful completion of this project will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the connection between gut bacteria and the brain. It will provide insight into the gut microbiota disruption's potential contribution to the development of mood and behavioural disorders. This knowledge may help researchers develop novel approaches to maintaining mental health.Project leadershipThe project lead is Paul Forsythe at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.

Health, General",Medical research,Molecular and Structural Mechanisms of Astrocyte-Mediated Cognitive Enhancement,MOLECULAR AND STRUCTURAL MECHANISMS OF ASTROCYTE-MEDIATED COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT,"Long-lasting memories define who we are and how we experience the world. Inability to form and access these memories, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), degrades quality of life and imposes a major burden on healthcare systems and society. Unfortunately, medical treatments that can prevent, slow down, or reverse memory deficits are non-existent. To develop new strategies for targeting diseases associated with memory impairments, a better understanding of how the brain acquires and encodes memories is urgently needed, and novel mechanisms must be effectively harnessed for therapeutic value. Recent studies have revealed the unique abilities of astrocytes, star-shaped cells in the brain, to communicate with surrounding neurons, which plays an important role in enhancing memory formation. These findings represent a new perspective on how neural activity is regulated in the brain and they have significant implications for the development of cognitive augmentation treatments that can be applied in diseases such as AD.    This project will apply cutting-edge techniques to investigate the effect of astrocytic activation on the physiological, molecular, and structural properties of astrocytes and their neighbouring neurons and circuits. It will use this knowledge to rescue or mitigate cellular pathology, functional disruptions, and cognitive deficits in AD mice models. Results will provide a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms by which astrocytes directly regulate memory formation and uncover new modes of therapeutic intervention for brain diseases such as AD. Additionally, the project will provide a strong research environment, as well as capacity building and exchange opportunities for graduate students, clinicians, and researchers based in Chile and China. The project is led in Canada by McGill University, working in collaboration with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, Zhejiang University in China, and Universidad de Chile.This project was selected for funding through the fourth research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program.

Las actividades realizadas para dar a conocer el proyecto últimas han sido reuniones presenciales con la DREA y la Escuela Virgen del Carmen, visita de seguimiento y campaña de información a todos los alumnos, padres y madres. Se plantea abordar mediante una intervención de un año de duración y una fase posterior de seguimiento y consolidación de impactos. La fase de seguimiento y consolidación de impactos será llevada a cabo por los equipos de profesionales peruanos y españoles mediante el apoyo de la Universidad de Sevilla. La hipótesis que subyace a la lógica de intervención, plantea como resultado instaurar y fortalecer las capacidades del personal responsable de gestionar los servicios de apoyo y atención a los docentes y personal educativo de los centros de la región, cuyo cometido es brindar apoyo y asesoramiento a las instituciones educativas inclusivas, a los centros específicos de educación especial y a los estudiantes con NEE asociadas a discapacidad y a sus familias.
