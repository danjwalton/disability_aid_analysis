The aim is to strengthen the capacity of local organizations and thus enable the improvement of the social services these organizations provide the victim with the Ukrainian population. Swedish civil society organizations (CSOs) that have framework agreements with Sida and awarded EU funding, can apply for a grant for the self-financing of the project budget from Sida in accordance with the strategy. The aim is to encourage Swedish CSOs to increasingly seek funding from the EU. Sida rely its assessment on the assessment the EU Commission conducted, as well as accept the format of the report that the EU uses. European Commission contract reference of the operation is ECHO / UKR / BUD / 2016/911012. The initiative has a total budget of 1.11 million euros, equivalent to about 10,600,500 SEK. Of this, Save the Children granted 90 percent of the European Commission and, with this decision, 10 per cent from Sida.The contribution has been prepared in Sida's management as a so-called simplified preparation, when it is less than 5 million. It has been assessed thoroughly by the main funder (European Commission) and Sida has therefore chosen not to do in-depth analysis of all the areas that are usually part of a preparation, without relying on the assessment made by the EU.Expected results are as follows:1. Parents and communities are better equipped to care for and protect children involved in the psychosocial program that aims to reduce their suffering and to strengthen their resilience and that vulnerable children with special needs is provided adequate support.2.

Since there is a great lack of statistics and analysis, the project will also include a component for knowledge building, methodology development, and the like. A significant portion of households in Syria are headed by women and the proportion of people with disabilities is very high (both physical disability and psychosocial).

It will attend and involve youth both in and out of school and it aims to reach in total around 8000 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs.

Project justification: #The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.#4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their childrens development. The project will also continue to expose and motivate the CBOs in East Jerusalem to participate in the Big Brother Big Sister programme.#5.

It will attend and involve youth both in and out of school and it aims to reach in total around 8000 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs. In addition the project will capacitate adults to support young people's life skills and participation. This will be done by training teachers CSO workers and activitists as well as organizing awareness raising events in the project implementation areas.,Significant gender component,No disability component,Suomen lasten ja nuorten säätiö,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Significant,Yes,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Suomen Lasten Ja Nuorten Säätiö,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers.

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers. Estimated number of children is 370-420 of them 60-80 children with special needs.,Significant gender component,Significant disability component,Psychologists for Social Responsibility,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Psychologists For Social Responsibility,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Some 40-50 of the children have specific needs and the Family Guidance Centers have cooperation with 10 special schools. In the previous year all of them were showing good progress with one forth completing the treatment and 70% of the children withspecific needs showing good improvement. Social workers helped parents to findbetter ways to deal with and support their children (412 home visits). A special reason for continuing the project is that after 20 years the programstaff wants to update the service policy and develop a strategic plan. Therefore besides treatments and guidance the work history and actual working environments are reflected carefully. The staff collects their observations data andknowledge in order to develop a new model. They will  combine experience of client-centred work to the community oriented practice. It is not easy because the community and the children there are in turmoil. Through the collective effortto understand how to best shape the service the staff and administration will develop a strategic plan for mental health services. Best service for the most needy people is the motto of the mental health program of NISCVT. The strategic planning process addresses gender equality reducing inequality climate sustainability as well as questions of financial institutional social and ecological sustainabily. These are not new issues but placed in the new frame. NISCVT sees health as a human rights question issue. This is the basis of the service from prevention promotion treatment and rehabilitation to how to help each child deal with their difficulties.,Significant gender component,Significant disability component,Finnish-Arab Friendship Society,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Finnish-arab Friendship Society,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

Reasons are lack of necessary knowhow and resources among municipal decision makers, parents of disabled children, teachers, and other local community influential people. Additionally, schools are often inaccessible and teachers lack skills to work with disabled children. Many disabled children thus are left without possibility of studying. Additionally in traditional culture children are often isolated from all social networks and their development is thus slowed or prevented. The traditional operating model is contrary to human rights and through this project traditional operating models are changed to realize human rights of disabled people. Expected development effects: realization of the human rights of disabled people in Lushoto province. Results of activities (i) community integration of rehabilitated disabled people, (ii) growth in skills of kindergarten and elementary school teachers to work with disbled children, and disabled children are able to attend school, (iii) improved health status of disabled children, and (iv) local leaders and civil servants are aware of Tanzanian disability legislation and implement the rights of disabled people in education. There are 2520 beneficiaries of the project (1045W ja 845M as carers of disabled children, including disabled youth and children 300G ja 330B) and 792 bearers of responsibility. 6860 individual benefit from the project indirectly. The target groups are disabled people, key individuals of organizations, and civil servants. The project is implemented by the northern diocese of the Church of Tanzanie, which is a forerunner in advocating for the rights of disabled people in Tanzania. The know-how of two of the churchs institutions is joined in this project: the know-how of the Rainbow school for developmentally disabled children in detective and community based disability work and the know-how of the Sebastian Kolowa Memorial University in special education and advocacy. Through cooperation, the right to livelihood of disabled people are strengthened through  rehabilitation and education, because the project affects, in addition to families and local communitites, also the increase in know-how of realization of rights of disabled people among responsible authorities, teachers, and local community leaders.",Significant gender component,Not screened,Suomen Lähetysseura ry,Donor country-based NGO,22000,Principal,Yes,No,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,intellectual,Mixed,Suomen Lähetysseura Ry,Other channel,20000,Donor country-based NGO

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers.

Project justification: #The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.#4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their childrens development.
