However poor quality and availability of teacher training together with limited resources for teaching and learning are affecting children's basic skills development namely literacy and numeracy skills. Especially teachers gaps in teaching reading in local languages are serious challenges that affect education quality and childrens illiteracy. The situation is most serious in Sub-Saharan Africa where more than 85% of children are not learning the minimum reading level until the end of primary education. There is a widespread agreement that the pre-service training and in-service professional development of teachers is a key component for improving childrens reading and success in life. The aim of this project is to enhance the capacities and pedagogical competences of the primary school teachers and special education teachers to teach and support reading and provide tools to improve literacy instruction of children at-risk for reading disabilities and children in general education. This continuation project is based on the preparation phase of eLearning teacher training programme for literacy learning and teaching in Sub-Saharan Africa (eTALE) financially supported by MFA as a disability project in 2015 and continued with funds carried over to 2016 (www.taleafrica.com).

It will work in two locations one in a poor Maputo suburban neighbourhood and the other in Marracuene district of the Maputo Province. It will attend and involve youth both in and out of school and it aims to reach in total around 8000 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs. In addition the project will capacitate adults to support young people's life skills and participation. This will be done by training teachers CSO workers and activitists as well as organizing awareness raising events in the project implementation areas.,Significant gender component,No disability component,Suomen lasten ja nuorten säätiö,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

While girls are the center of social change local communities will also be targeted to facilitate girl empowerment. The project will initially work with eight communities in two districts Mtwara Municipal and Mtwara Rural. These communities were chosen with local education and health authorities who highlighted the low secondary school attendance poor academic performance and high teenage pregnancy rates of girls in these communities. Through a participatory process with adolescent girls we then established the reasons and viable solutions to these problems.The central issue to be addressed is poor academic performance which according to girls themselves is due to critical reasons such as; gender-based violence; harassment in and on the way to school; negative parental attitudes towards girls education due to traditional gender norms; lack of positive female role models; and girls low expectations of employability after education. Furthermore insufficient knowledge of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) combined with traditional cultural practices of encouraging adolescent sexual relations and a lack of contraceptives is leading to many school-aged pregnancies.The project will work with young girls schools and key stakeholders in the communities. Girls Action Clubs (GACs) will provide a safe space for both in and out of school girls to share experiences and learn essential life skills and SRHR. 50 peer leaders and 24 adult tutors will be trained for GACs. GACs will utilise sports drama and dance to attract members but the main focus will be on providing training & education for their participants.Special education will be emphasised to the Unyago which is a training for young girls (6-13 year of age) about household activities and how to treat future husbands properly. Unyago training is one main reason why young girls get pregnant at early age and drop out from school.

Project justification: #The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.#4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their childrens development.

It will attend and involve youth both in and out of school and it aims to reach in total around 8000 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs. In addition the project will capacitate adults to support young people's life skills and participation.

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers.

While girls are the center of social change local communities will also be targeted to facilitate girl empowerment. The project will initially work with eight communities in two districts Mtwara Municipal and Mtwara Rural. These communities were chosen with local education and health authorities who highlighted the low secondary school attendance poor academic performance and high teenage pregnancy rates of girls in these communities. Through a participatory process with adolescent girls we then established the reasons and viable solutions to these problems.The central issue to be addressed is poor academic performance which according to girls themselves is due to critical reasons such as; gender-based violence; harassment in and on the way to school; negative parental attitudes towards girls education due to traditional gender norms; lack of positive female role models; and girls low expectations of employability after education. Furthermore insufficient knowledge of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) combined with traditional cultural practices of encouraging adolescent sexual relations and a lack of contraceptives is leading to many school-aged pregnancies.The project will work with young girls schools and key stakeholders in the communities. Girls Action Clubs (GACs) will provide a safe space for both in and out of school girls to share experiences and learn essential life skills and SRHR. 50 peer leaders and 24 adult tutors will be trained for GACs. GACs will utilise sports drama and dance to attract members but the main focus will be on providing training & education for their participants.Special education will be emphasised to the Unyago which is a training for young girls (6-13 year of age) about household activities and how to treat future husbands properly.

Lack of land but also skills and knowledge, low educational level to improve livelihoods and income generation are challenges the refugees, and Ugandans, face daily. In line with the CRRF of the Govt of Uganda the project contributes towards increased self-reliance of refugees by strengthening resilience capacities of beneficiaries to cope better with current obstacles and to become less vulnerable in future, by improving their livelihood skills and access to resources. The project arranges short courses on Business Skill for refugees and for Ugandans living near settlements and in Urban Kampala. The other support provided is facilitation of formation of saving and loan groups  the project trains the group on principles of VSLA activity and donates a saving kit to each group formed. Both Business Skill and saving trainings are followed by mentoring and advisory services from the professional project staff. The beneficiaries are expected to enhance their ability to meet essential needs and to enjoy social and economic rights as part of their progress towards self-reliance.The general target group is refugees above 15 years old, who reside in Uganda in settlements or urban Kampala area, and their educational and skill level is in need of improvement. Special attention is put on the equal participation of women and youth. The target for women participants is 50% whereas target for people with special needs is 3 - 5% of beneficiaries. As recommended by OPM and UNHCR, the project will also target Ugandans living nearby settlements so that they are about 20%. As direct beneficiaries the 160 individual Business Skill Facilitators gain important skills and capacities in teaching and facilitation, and knowledge in business and livelihood related matters. They are trained to teach the 8-module course for the business learning group, and have a key role in implementing the project. Largest nationality group targeted will be South Sudanese in settlements in North Uganda, followed by refugees from DRC, Burundi, Rwanda and Somalia in settlements in South West Uganda. Majority of refugees arrive from villages with skills and experience related to agriculture and livestock rearing. However, at settlements their opportunities to practise agriculture are limited due to restricted access to land, farm inputs and markets.

We will expand our collaborative studies with a Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Uganda by first exploring the epidemiology of all types of DDD in children ages 1-9 years using a three-stage screening process. Next, we will train a team of community and health workers for a controlled early intervention study on these children in collaboration with UNICEF. In addition, we will perform a 3-year longitudinal follow up of our previously identified cohort of children with cerebral palsy and design, execute and evaluate goal directed interventions. Critical knowledge gaps in global outcomes for children with DDD will be addressed through this project and successful interventions will be scaled up and disseminated to other nations by the UNICEF collaboration.",Significant gender component,Not screened,Karolinska Institutet,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,51000,Principal,No,Not inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"education, family"

Health, General",Medical research,Molecular and Structural Mechanisms of Astrocyte-Mediated Cognitive Enhancement,MOLECULAR AND STRUCTURAL MECHANISMS OF ASTROCYTE-MEDIATED COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT,"Long-lasting memories define who we are and how we experience the world. Inability to form and access these memories, as in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), degrades quality of life and imposes a major burden on healthcare systems and society. Unfortunately, medical treatments that can prevent, slow down, or reverse memory deficits are non-existent. To develop new strategies for targeting diseases associated with memory impairments, a better understanding of how the brain acquires and encodes memories is urgently needed, and novel mechanisms must be effectively harnessed for therapeutic value. Recent studies have revealed the unique abilities of astrocytes, star-shaped cells in the brain, to communicate with surrounding neurons, which plays an important role in enhancing memory formation. These findings represent a new perspective on how neural activity is regulated in the brain and they have significant implications for the development of cognitive augmentation treatments that can be applied in diseases such as AD.    This project will apply cutting-edge techniques to investigate the effect of astrocytic activation on the physiological, molecular, and structural properties of astrocytes and their neighbouring neurons and circuits. It will use this knowledge to rescue or mitigate cellular pathology, functional disruptions, and cognitive deficits in AD mice models. Results will provide a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms by which astrocytes directly regulate memory formation and uncover new modes of therapeutic intervention for brain diseases such as AD. Additionally, the project will provide a strong research environment, as well as capacity building and exchange opportunities for graduate students, clinicians, and researchers based in Chile and China. The project is led in Canada by McGill University, working in collaboration with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, Zhejiang University in China, and Universidad de Chile.This project was selected for funding through the fourth research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program.

The cortex has undergone an evolutionary expansion and acquired a more sophisticated organization in humans. While the rodent cortex is small and smooth, human and primate cortices are large and convoluted. Nevertheless, key structural features have remained conserved throughout evolution. For instance, the neocortex is subdivided into four primary areas: visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor. The allocortex is similarly regionalized, and includes the caudomedial hippocampus, which is the seat of learning and memory. How regional patterning occurs during development has been carefully studied in rodent models. Whether similar processes underlie patterning of the human cortex is unknown, but this is an important area of study given the association between neuropsychiatric disorders and altered connectivity between the thalamus and cortex. This project will use human stem cells to generate self-organizing cerebral organoids (a smaller, simpler version of the organ to be studied) and on-chip cerebral organoid systems to model early brain development and to investigate complex neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, the project will provide a strong research environment, as well as capacity building and exchange opportunities, for graduate students and researchers based in India.

The insect models are simple to perform (peeling a shrimp), cost efficient, but still unique in its complexity (readout of a metabolically active whole brain). The equipment is readily accessible and require low maintenance; smart phone, insects, and fluorescent small molecules.  According to the Global Alliance of Health and Pollution, pollution, not disease, is the biggest killer in the developing world, taking more lives each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS. While adverse effects of pollutions are mainly studied by looking at the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, effects on the central nervous system (CNS) are not broadly recognized. However, in recent studies, pollution has been associated with variety diseases of the CNS, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders.  The insect models will allow more cost efficient access to toxicity profiling and thereby potentially increase the number of tests performed. The goal is to detect, prevent and reduce the amount of neurotoxic challenges in the environment, water supplies, and foods.

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers.

Some 40-50 of the children have specific needs and the Family Guidance Centers have cooperation with 10 special schools. In the previous year all of them were showing good progress with one forth completing the treatment and 70% of the children withspecific needs showing good improvement. Social workers helped parents to findbetter ways to deal with and support their children (412 home visits). A special reason for continuing the project is that after 20 years the programstaff wants to update the service policy and develop a strategic plan. Therefore besides treatments and guidance the work history and actual working environments are reflected carefully. The staff collects their observations data andknowledge in order to develop a new model. They will  combine experience of client-centred work to the community oriented practice. It is not easy because the community and the children there are in turmoil. Through the collective effortto understand how to best shape the service the staff and administration will develop a strategic plan for mental health services. Best service for the most needy people is the motto of the mental health program of NISCVT. The strategic planning process addresses gender equality reducing inequality climate sustainability as well as questions of financial institutional social and ecological sustainabily. These are not new issues but placed in the new frame. NISCVT sees health as a human rights question issue.

La presente propuesta pretende contribuir al derecho humano a la alimentación a través de lareducción de los índices de desnutrición crónica en Guatemala y de la prevención de nuevos casos.La propuesta centrará la acción en 12 municipios de una de las regiones con mayor incidencia de la desnutrición crónica entre los titulares de derechos, la población menor de 5 años, esto es,Huehuetenango (67.7%).Se propone una estrategia integral que pretende mejorar la calidad de atención de los servicios de salud con una perspectiva culturalmente adaptada, con énfasis en la nutrición y el monitoreo del crecimiento, tomando como base a la comunidad y a través de metodologías participativas de comunicación para el desarrollo, impulsando la participación de los titulares de responsabilidades en la problemática y facilitando la sostenibilidad de las acciones.Incluye como elementos clave, la práctica adecuada de las acciones de la Estrategia de los 1.000 días (desde la concepción hasta los primeros 2 años de edad), la mejora de las prácticas de higiene y saneamiento y el establecimiento de espacios comunitarios de estimulación oportuna para menores de 5 años. La estrategia considera como punto central a la comunidad, con el objetivo de que las comunidades sean sujetos de su propia vida y no solo receptoras de las intervenciones.El programa se enmarca en la Estrategia Nacional de Prevención de la Desnutrición Crónica 2016-2020 del Gobierno de Guatemala y propiciará la coordinación interinstitucional y el empoderamientode las comunidades como agentes clave para la prevención y reducción de la desnutrición crónica en Huehuetenango. No es un proyecto aislado, sino que pretende expandir acciones que ya sevienen desarrollando en 11 de los 33 municipios de este departamento, todos priorizados por el gobierno en la Estrategia Nacional de Prevención de la Desnutrición Crónica (Ver Anexo1.

The purpose is to strengthen the capacity of the partner to respond to the challenges concerning environment and family welfare in the area. The school system in Iraqi Kurdistan uses subject teachers from kindergarten and teachers have little training in child-centered education methods. There is a wide variety in the access and quality of services to the disabled children: even a town with 100 000 inhabitants is without any services. Environment is a new theme for the Kurds, littering nature and spending water in excess is common. About one million IDPs and Syrian refugees have entered Iraqi Kurdistan until September 2014. Especially Christian IDPs and refugees have seeked refuge in Ankawa, an Arab Christian suburb of Erbil. The partners of Fida are small local NGOs as well as governmental education offices in Sulaymaniyah Governorate. In Erbil Governorate, Fida partners with Assemblies of God Church, Ankawa. Fida trains school and kindergarten teachers in addressing children with special needs and applying child-centered education methods. Fida coaches the partners into good project administration as well as consideration of gender, children s rights and psycho-social needs. Fida supports the church in Ankawa in relief work and in planning a school for the refugee and IDP children. In 2013, the environmental organization arranged an awareness week at two secondary schools. As a consequence, there are environment clubs at both schools with one hundred members in total. New child-centered methods are in use at some kindergartens in Halabja. The partner working with the disabled has guided the families with disabled children in access to governmental services and provided psychosocial support by visiting the homes.

WHAT: In the project quality of the education and guidance for the visually impaired is promoted through production of assistive devices for teaching.  WHY: The politically unstable situation and the bureaucracy in Palestine make it more difficult for the NGOs to act in the area. Some of special schools have difficulties to guarantee the right materials for their visually impaired students since the remedial education material unit under Ministry of Education is unable to produce enough Braille materials for every student. At the same time the expensive Braille printers owned by the schools are unused because the government no longer covers the expenses.  HOW: The association for the parents of visually impaired children is offering valuable peer support and information which helps the parents acknowledge the needs of visually impaired children better. When these needs are met the inclusive education and social participation are eased for the visually impaired. The project benefits the visually impaired children that have the opportunity whose school attendance can be guaranteed.

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO s have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is  also  member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.  Finland  has channelled 6.060.000 million euros to the partnership  (2012-2015).

They also work with local schools to build inclusive structures in order to support the participation of disabled children to primary education. Community volunteers are trained and motivated.  Consultation, medical aid and equipment are provided according to the needs and possibilities. The situation of persons with disabilities in the Lushoto district is poor; prejudices are common and there are no rehabilitation or educational opportunities for disabled children. Disabled, specifically mentally impaired, children are seen as burden for their families and they are often kept hidden at home. There is a huge need for proper information and concrete support. The program aims to raise awareness of the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities. Families living with  disabilities are supported and right to education is improved by inclusive education initiatives and classes run by community volunteers. The beneficiaries of the program are the disabled children, their families and community members.

The project focuses mainly on producing shea nuts (aiming for 6,000 additional tons during this project), as well as shallots, onion, and garlic (aiming for 15,000 additional tons). This increased production, combined with more efficient processing, is anticipated to boost sales by 10,000 tons for the shallot, onion, and garlic supply chain, and by 4,000 tons for shea nuts. To achieve these results, the project strengthens the production, productivity, marketing and organizational management capacities of 150 participating organizations.   The project also focuses on strengthening gender equality by emphasizing activities usually initiated by women. Women are thus in a better position to meet their specific needs, while increasing their influence in several sectors (economic, social, and political).

La progression de l'État islamique en Irak et au Levant (EIIL) en des zones toujours plus larges de Syrie, a des conséquences importantes pour les civils. On rapporte notamment de graves violations des droits humains dans les zones sous contrôle de l'EIIL. Les hostilités ont endommagé et détruit hôpitaux de terrain, écoles, accès à l'eau et services d'électricité, dans les zones densément peuplées où communautés locales et personnes déplacées cohabitent.  Le nombre total de personnes nécessitant une aide d'urgence en Syrie a atteint les 12,2 millions, dont environ 7,6 millions sont des personnes déplacées  soit le plus grand nombre au monde de personnes déplacées à l'intérieur d'un même pays. Les civils demeurant les premières victimes du conflit. L'ampleur des besoins humanitaires est écrasante dans toutes les régions du pays. La première priorité est le traitement et l'évacuation des blessés, ainsi que l'organisation d'une aide alimentaire, d'un accès à l'eau, de soins de santé, d'abris, de sanitaires et d'une hygiène de base.  Dans le domaine de la santé, le conflit aura notamment eu pour conséquence durable, la privation de tout accès aux soins de santé de base pour beaucoup de gens. Selon les rapports, davantage de Syriens décèdent des suites de complications sanitaires résultant de soins de santé inadaptés, plutôt que des suites directes des violences qu'ils ont subies. Les établissements médicaux restent les cibles de bombardements aériens, ces derniers résultant en toujours plus de blessés et de destructions d'infrastructures.   -Global objective:  Contribuer à atténuer l'impact du conflit en Syrie sur les personnes blessées, handicapées ou en situation de vulnérabilité, en particulier les femmes et les enfants, en répondant à leurs besoins spécifiques et leurs besoins de base urgents.  -Specific objective :  Réduire la vulnérabilité des personnes affectées par la crise en Syrie à travers la fourniture de soins de réadaptation physique, fonctionnelle et psychosociale, le soutien aux hôpitaux et centres de santé locaux, et des activités d'éducation aux risques inhérents aux les Armes Conventionnelles.    -Intended results :  - Résultat 1 L'accès des personnes blessées et/ou handicapées à des services de réadaptation physique, fonctionnelle et psychosociale de qualité est amélioré en Nord Syrie.  - Résultat 2 Les connaissances et la maitrise des bonnes pratiques de sécurité po  -",Significant gender component,Not screened,NGO Handicap International Belgium,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Principal,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"education, advocacy"

Les effets du conflit armé au Mali ont été importants et multiples, notamment l'aggravation de la situation humanitaire préexistante (crise alimentaire et nutritionnelle) et le déplacement d'environ 500 000 personnes au plus fort de la crise. La région de Tombouctou connait actuellement un calme précaire, avec des pics de tensions récurrents qui fragilisent toujours les populations, et a mis à mal la cohésion sociale entre les différentes communautés.

En el primer proyecto (2012), se establecieron criterios para crear y consolidar la red de trabajo formada por centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones públicas. En 2013 sumamos la participación activa de dos ONGDs centroamericanas y centramos el trabajo en la defensa de los derechos de las mujeres. En 2014 (en ejecución) seguimos en la misma línea, pero transfiriendo el conocimiento de unos pueblos a otros que se sumaron al proceso. En 2015, tras valorar la incidencia que se está teniendo, seguimos profundizando con las organizaciones municipales en colaboración con dos asociaciones feministas centroamericanas: Mujeres Transformando (El Salvador) y La Cuerda (Guatemala); daremos continuidad al trabajo en los centros educativos que más se han implicado de los que se han sumado en el proyecto en ejecución, sin perder la continuidad con el centro de educación especial de Castro del Río; y se garantiza el uso de los espacios públicos necesarios contando con todas las bibliotecas como eje de transmisión de conocimiento. En este proyecto el objetivo es informar, comprometer y dotar de capacidad de movilización a la ciudadanía andaluza para detectar y enfrentar los micromachismos, trabajándolo específicamente, con centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones públicas municipales de Córdoba, Sevilla, Málaga y Jaén. El primer resultado se basa en consolidar la red de trabajo de centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones de ocho municipios andaluces y dos organizaciones feministas centroamericanas, para trabajar, generar sinergias e intercambiar experiencias. El segundo resultado se centra en el trabajo con los centros educativos mediante la ejecución de la nueva unidad didáctica que recoge las lecciones aprendidas en el proceso y propone un encuentro de los centros para intercambiar experiencias, evaluar y darle continuidad. El tercer resultado es fruto del trabajo realizado con los colectivos que avanzarán en la formación en género junto con las dos organizaciones centroamericanas, para ello se organizarán unas jornadas en las que planificaremos colectivamente el trabajo que luego realizaremos con cada colectivo para editar una herramienta audiovisual y realizar una campaña de incidencia en el municipio que desenmascare los micromachismos y defienda los derechos de las mujeres. El cuarto resultado se centra en fortalecer la capacidad de incidencia de centros educativos, colectivos y bibliotecas en Córdoba, Sevilla, Málaga y Jaén mediante la dotación de recursos: envío de materiales educativos, incorporación de artículos en la revista Pueblos sobre Centroamérica y África subsahariana; diseño, edición, publicación y muestra de una exposición fotográfica sobre los derechos de las mujeres en colaboración con La Cuerda; y participación en medios de comunicación.",Principal gender component,Not screened,,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

Tteaching language in secondary schools is mainly English and the deaf are not offered any help in interpretation. A significant number of deaf pupils drop out from school due to the lack of opportunities to study effectively; consequently they find it extremely challenging to find employment. The main goal of the project is to improve the opportunities for deaf pupils to increase their chances to complete the secondary education. The Deaf Unit at Meru Primary School (MPS) in Arusha is chosen to receive a specific information technology targeted learning environment. This enhancement is achieved by supporting continuing training for teachers and developing the skills of all pupils in information technology data searching data processing and in the English language.An important aspect of the technological learning environment is the learning centre. The data projector all computers and room lighting are powered by solar energy. The centre will introduce information technology clubs training for teachers/student teachers as well as classroom teaching. To support and maintain the educational and technical infrastructure two persons with both IT and sign language skills will be employed.The beneficiaries are the deaf young people including those who have dropped out from education and local young IT supportive teams. This project and its unique training support will also benefit the area?s teachers by providing IT expertise to the teachers at MPS and other educational staff around Arusha in turn enabling them all to offer the most appropriate learning environment for disadvantaged children. Those studying at the Patandi Teachers? College will gain experience in practice. Thus the target of effectively teaching deaf children can be further enhanced and improved.This project will support the rights of the young disabled and socially displaced minorities. Also gender equality will be effectuated by implementing the new teaching method to more female pupils. At present the deaf female/male pupil ratio in MPS is 36/43. With the new tuition method the numbers of female pupils entering secondary education will most likely see a significant increase.The Arusha Special Needs Education Coordinator the headmaster of MPS and FSE ry has jointly developed this project.

Most importantly, the aim is to increase the use of participatory and integrative teaching approach in teaching English, Geography and History. Additionally, themes such as environmental issues, social aspects of the hiv and aids -pandemia and gender equality will be holistically integrated in the mentioned subjects. Teachers' skills will be strengthened both in theoretical knowledge and practical training. Also research articles will be produced. During the recent years, secondary education in Tanzania has been characterised by a growing number of schools and students, and at the same time, by an alarming rate of failure in national Form 4 examinations. In the area of teaching approach, the Ministry of Education of Tanzania has introduced a curriculum change for secondary school subjects, including a shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered participatory approach. The introduction of new syllabuses has not been accompanied by adequate in-service training for the teachers working in the field. This has caused confusion, uncertainty and resistance among the teachers initially trained according to the principles of the traditional teacher-centered approach. PITA Project will be implemented in collaboration between TUMA University Faculty of Education, Meru District Education authorities and selected secondary schools. The project benefits the secondary school teachers and students but on top of that, it offers the academic programmes an opportunity to test and apply participatory and integrative teaching methods in practical grass root level teaching and to develop the teacher training programmes to meet the requirements and challenges of the Tanzanian reality. In 2014 a background survey was conducted and 20 econdary schools with approximately 4.200 students and 120 teachers chosen to the project.Menetelmänä on järjestää koulutusseminaareja ja käytännön työpajoja yliopistolla sen henkilökunnalle sekä projektikoulujen opettajille.

The method is to arrange training seminars and practical workshops at the University to the university staff and secondary school teachers and the knowledge and the learned knowledge will be taken to practice in supported class room sessions. Also learning difficulties and learning disabilities will be addressed.  PITA project is implemented by Tumaini University Makumira (TUMa) which is FELM's longtime partner.

In collaboration with our network of African literacy experts we aim to address this huge challenge of literacy learning and teaching to boost the development of primary education in Africa. In our project we focus on enhancing the primary school teachers? skills to teach reading in local African Bantu languages by developing a comprehensive step by step digital learning environment for teachers. The content of the eLearning environment will be created during the project together with the partner institutions.The teaching content will be developed during the alternating  phases of  trial and piloting phases over the course of 3 year project. The created materials will assist teachers to use effective methodology in literacy instruction in local Bantu languages which will enhance the children?s prospects of acquiring basic reading skills especially those children with special needs. Thus contributing to the improvement in teaching and learning outcomes. Finland is among the countries which have the highest literacy rates in the world. International research shows that the major factor behind this success is the nature of Finnish alphabetic system (transparent) and teaching method that is compatible with the regular orthography (there is only one way to spell a word or read a word). Nearly all Bantu languages in Africa have similar transparent alphabetic system to Finnish providing the opportunity to apply Finnish teaching methods and expertise at the time when the language policies and strategies have been revised so that mother tongue or local languages are used as a medium of literacy learning and instruction in primary schools. The project will support the children's right to quality education by boosting the teachers? skills in literacy teaching and the special needs children's opportunities for learning.,Principal gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Niilo Mäki Foundation",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,Not inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family"

Education, Level Unspecified",Teacher training,Transitioning Afghan Special School to Inclusive Education (TASSTIE),TRANSITIONING AFGHAN SPECIAL SCHOOL TO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION (TASSTIE),Inequality and inequity in education remain matter of great concern in Afghanistan. Approximately 50% of children remain out of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend due to the lack of inclusiveness.  With support from Serve the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive & Child Friendly Education Policy in order to ensure access to and quality of education for all children regardless their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances.  The MoE has already begun trainings in Inclusive Education (IE) in several areas in Afghanistan including Nangahar province.SHIP school was established in 1991 to serve the educational needs of deaf children.  The school later expanded to educating children with intellectual disabilities and then recently in 2012 we began our reverse inclusion where the disabled and non-disabled children could be educated together in the same classroom. Many said this would not be possible. However SHIP has proven that it is possible. Serve s goal from its beginning has been to create inclusive communities.  We now believe the community is ready to begin handover of the SHIP school to the MoE as an example of inclusive education.  In order to make this a reality we will work with students parents community and other relevant stakeholders to begin advocacy with the government to take complete responsibility for the education of the students.  We believe this is possible because the government has already taken the responsibility for other special schools.  To accomplish the objective of SHIP handover the following steps will be taken:1. Preparation of MoE schools by implementing Serve Inclusive Education (IE) model2. Preparation of SHIP students for inclusion in the prepared inclusive MoE schools. 3. Preparation of SHIP teachers parents and community for the handover4. Ensure normal and smooth operation of SHIP during the transitional periodWe will gradually release responsibility to the government after they have been trained and equipped with the necessary skills and tools to provide sustainable and quality education for all students. After the handover Serve will continue to follow-up and support the inclusive MoE schools through the CBR (Community-based Rehabilitation) function of SHIP capacity of which will be increased to support increased number of clients.,Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Operaatio Mobilisaatio ry",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family"

There are very few schools for deaf in the whole country. In addition, special classes for deaf children exist in ordinary schools but after 4th grade they have to attend ordinary classes where the teachers usually do not have sign language skills. The project includes also complementary training courses for teachers working with deaf children and for education sector functionaries responsible for special education. The courses are organized in cooperation with the local Association of the Deaf and the Ministry of Education. In addition, the project increases knowledge about deafness and looks for advocacy opportunities as well as contacts with deaf people and people interested in the work.

The overall objectives are to make a clear structure and model for the work activities at the SWAC Schools in Dhaka and Rangamati and create possibilities for safe and meaningful adulthood for the adults with ASDs. The SWAC personnel will be resourced so that they can sufficiently implement the working activities. Bangladesh government together with a local bank donated a plot of land to the SWAC last year. The architectural plan for the future work and activity center will be done following the principles for sustainable development and using local materials and labour. The job coach is at work and working places for some students at the SWAC are found.  Parents participate actively in their networks and the local model of adaptive training has been introduced to the activities of the SWAC. The project follows the crosscutting development policy objectives. It promotes gender equality and democracy reduces inequality and promotes the rights of the minorities by creating vocational education and possibilities for better future for the adults with ASDs in the capital area and in the tribal district of Rangamati. The project builds new structures and the most important of them is the work and activity center for the young adults with ASDs.  The main beneficiaries of the project are young adults with ASDs their parents siblings and other relatives and the teachers of the SWAC. The key activities are: to educate and support the SWAC personnel by giving them information arrange workshops evaluate and monitor their learning and exchange ideas with the  Finnish educational team. The architectural plan is made together with Finnish and local architects on 2015.The job coach will be trained to work at the SWAC. Adaptation training for the parents and families will be modeled to the local context as part of the SWAC activities by the support of Finnish educational team.

However, CP is a common cause of movement disability and it has a devastating impact on the child and its family affecting occupational activities, social relationships, psychological well-being and financial conditions. We plan to perform a randomized controlled study comparing clusters of villages with the community based program to villages maintaining the ordinary health services. However, before commencing the intervention we need to understand the panorama of CP in Uganda. There is little information available about the epidemiology of CP in Sub-Saharan Africa. We are currently studying a hospital cohort at Mulago University Hospital in Kampala, but there are obvious limitations. Therefore, we plan to perform a population-based epidemiology study on CP at the Iganga DSS, in which we will explore the prevalence, type of CP, severity level, associated risk factors as well as available rehabilitative and therapeutic services.

The profound ethical guideline in the project: Children with special needs have the right for decent human development and protection regardless of their condition as well as being refugees. The purpose of the project is:1) to secure places (36) in special schools institutions or individually tailored rehabilitation process for children and adolescents with multiple special needs referred by Family Guidance Centers of BAS2)  to arrange for parents and siblings meetings workshops and recreational activities for rest recovery and peer support and encouraging them to advocacy and making proposals.3) promote access to special education and rehabilitation services and possibilities of BAS to enhance services in reduced price offered by specialised entities.

Pour parvenir à atteindre notre objectif, il est important que la population acquière une meilleure connaissance du handicap mais aussi des causes fondamentales liées à ce type de handicap (les facteurs périnataux sont une des causes principales du handicap intellectuel). Il est aussi nécessaire d'informer la population à travers des campagnes massives (spots télévisés/ brochures) mais aussi de préparer le personnel médical qui, centré sur la survie de la mère et du nouveau -né, ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences de certaines pratiques sur les conditions de vie de ces personnes dans le futur, ou minimise certains facteurs de risque.Résultat 2 Les services de diagnostic, orientation, et stimulation précoce ont des compétences actualisées sur la problématique liée à la déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde. Afin d'appuyer les familles à faire face à ce type de handicap, mais aussi permettre à l'enfant ou au jeune une évolution vers une plus grande autonomie, il est important de coordonner tous les efforts et les expertises existantes dans le pays, au service d'un programme d'appui aux parents au sein de leur communauté.

The purpose is to strengthen the capacity of the partner to respond to the challenges concerning environment and family welfare in the area. The school system in Iraqi Kurdistan uses subject teachers from kindergarten and teachers have little training in child-centered education methods. There is a wide variety in the access and quality of services to the disabled children: even a town with 100 000 inhabitants is without any services. Environment is a new theme for the Kurds, littering nature and spending water in excess is common. About one million IDPs and Syrian refugees have entered Iraqi Kurdistan until September 2014. Especially Christian IDPs and refugees have seeked refuge in Ankawa, an Arab Christian suburb of Erbil. The partners of Fida are small local NGOs as well as governmental education offices in Sulaymaniyah Governorate. In Erbil Governorate, Fida partners with Assemblies of God Church, Ankawa. Fida trains school and kindergarten teachers in addressing children with special needs and applying child-centered education methods. Fida coaches the partners into good project administration as well as consideration of gender, children s rights and psycho-social needs. Fida supports the church in Ankawa in relief work and in planning a school for the refugee and IDP children. In 2013, the environmental organization arranged an awareness week at two secondary schools. As a consequence, there are environment clubs at both schools with one hundred members in total. New child-centered methods are in use at some kindergartens in Halabja. The partner working with the disabled has guided the families with disabled children in access to governmental services and provided psychosocial support by visiting the homes.

Some of special schools have difficulties to guarantee the right materials for their visually impaired students since the remedial education material unit under Ministry of Education is unable to produce enough Braille materials for every student. At the same time the expensive Braille printers owned by the schools are unused because the government no longer covers the expenses.HOW: The association for the parents of visually impaired children is offering valuable peer support and information which helps the parents acknowledge the needs of visually impaired children better. When these needs are met the inclusive education and social participation are eased for the visually impaired.

Government & Civil Society-general,Human rights,INT/UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons With Disabilities UNPRPD,INT/UN PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES UNPRPD,It is estimated that more than a billion people - about 15 % of the world s population - live with some form of disability. They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing projects which may be local or global and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO s have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the second biggest donor goverment after Australia and she is currently also one of the donor government members of the UNPRPD Policy Board.  Finland  has channelled 206 million euros to the partnership during 2012-2013.

Communications,Communications policy and administrative management,Exploring the Value of Openness in the Digital Economy,EXPLORING THE VALUE OF OPENNESS IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY,"Intellectual property protections, such as copyright, play an increasingly important and complex role in international trade and domestic economic legislation. The increasingly digital nature of economies, even in the developing world, is one reason for this phenomenon. The Internet, and intermediaries such as Apple s iTunes, now serve as the main sources for knowledge and creative goods (including music, film, books) under copyright protection. Meanwhile, the growth of digital piracy (copying and online file sharing), and the creative economy s increasing value, have made the debate on the role of copyright even more pressing. The debate includes two polarized positions. On the one hand, people are pushing for stronger intellectual property protections. The last two decades have seen national legislation and international agreements bring in tighter intellectual property enforcement in the digital environment. For example, recent trade treaties include proposals to restrict domestic flexibility in intellectual property policy.On the other hand, there is a movement to promote greater flexibility in intellectual property protections for a more open Internet. A growing number of countries have enacted, or are considering, flexible  fair use -style legislations. Open access and open educational initiatives, which also include more flexible approaches to copyright, are also gaining strength and broadening their scope. An international treaty to expand access to materials for people with visual impairments also recognized limitations and exceptions to copyright.Most of the policy debates about copyright protection in the digital age lack empirical evidence to support the claims on both sides. This research project will address that gap. Researchers will:-establish an interdisciplinary and global network to examine the economic and social impact of copyright flexibilities, legal enforcement, and alternative licensing systems;-organize activities at the University of Cape Town to bring researchers, civil society, industry, and policymakers together to discuss intellectual property issues;-identify urgent, global, and local research priorities, and analyze global interconnections; and,-outline a research agenda exploring the value of open and flexible approaches to intellectual property in the digital economy.Funding will also allow leading Asian and Latin American researchers to participate in the 2013 Global Congress on Public and Intellectual Property in Cape Town. Consumers International will coordinate the second part of this project, which will produce comparable data on how different types of copyright reforms and flexibilities influence consumers and innovative businesses. The survey design, and the diagnostic and planning exercise, will provide the basis for a long-term research network that will produce academic work on the value of openness in developing countries  digital economies.",No gender component,Not screened,Consumers International,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,Not inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education"

Sida rely its assessment on the assessment the EU Commission conducted, as well as accept the format of the report that the EU uses. European Commission contract reference of the operation is ECHO / UKR / BUD / 2016/911012. The initiative has a total budget of 1.11 million euros, equivalent to about 10,600,500 SEK. Of this, Save the Children granted 90 percent of the European Commission and, with this decision, 10 per cent from Sida.The contribution has been prepared in Sida's management as a so-called simplified preparation, when it is less than 5 million. It has been assessed thoroughly by the main funder (European Commission) and Sida has therefore chosen not to do in-depth analysis of all the areas that are usually part of a preparation, without relying on the assessment made by the EU.Expected results are as follows:1.

The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000  each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is  also  member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.  Finland  has channelled 7.560.000 million euros to the partnership  (2012-2016) and will channel 15 million  in 2017.

Reasons are lack of necessary knowhow and resources among municipal decision makers, parents of disabled children, teachers, and other local community influential people. Additionally, schools are often inaccessible and teachers lack skills to work with disabled children. Many disabled children thus are left without possibility of studying. Additionally in traditional culture children are often isolated from all social networks and their development is thus slowed or prevented. The traditional operating model is contrary to human rights and through this project traditional operating models are changed to realize human rights of disabled people. Expected development effects: realization of the human rights of disabled people in Lushoto province. Results of activities (i) community integration of rehabilitated disabled people, (ii) growth in skills of kindergarten and elementary school teachers to work with disbled children, and disabled children are able to attend school, (iii) improved health status of disabled children, and (iv) local leaders and civil servants are aware of Tanzanian disability legislation and implement the rights of disabled people in education. There are 2520 beneficiaries of the project (1045W ja 845M as carers of disabled children, including disabled youth and children 300G ja 330B) and 792 bearers of responsibility. 6860 individual benefit from the project indirectly. The target groups are disabled people, key individuals of organizations, and civil servants. The project is implemented by the northern diocese of the Church of Tanzanie, which is a forerunner in advocating for the rights of disabled people in Tanzania. The know-how of two of the churchs institutions is joined in this project: the know-how of the Rainbow school for developmentally disabled children in detective and community based disability work and the know-how of the Sebastian Kolowa Memorial University in special education and advocacy. Through cooperation, the right to livelihood of disabled people are strengthened through  rehabilitation and education, because the project affects, in addition to families and local communitites, also the increase in know-how of realization of rights of disabled people among responsible authorities, teachers, and local community leaders.",Significant gender component,Not screened,Suomen Lähetysseura ry,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Principal,No,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family, advocacy"

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000  each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is  also  member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.  Finland  has channelled 7.560.000 million euros to the partnership  (2012-2016) and will channel 15 million  in 2017.

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers.

Only 3% of disabled children start school and more than half of them drop out in 1-3 years. Countryside is almost totally lacking educational and supporting services for severely disabled children and ignorance and discriminating attitudes cause enormous barriers to their  wellbeing. Without the support of community, parents and authorities, the children dont have possibility to develop their skills physically, socially or educationally.The project enhances the rights of children with severe disabilities (such as CP, autistic or intellectual dispability) by training communities and their leaders on disability issues and the rights of persons with disabilities, by supporting community-based activity-centres for integarted education and inclusive education in local schools as well as home based care, in Kampot and Kratie provinces. The work of the project implementer Komar Pikar Foundation (KPF) has proved that by community based solutions even the severely disabled children and their families can have access to education and supporting services and the discrimination can be reduced. As result of the project the children with severe disabilities are accepted as part of their communities, they have possibility to learn and develop their skills and have better access to e.g. health services.

Other Social Infrastructure & Services,Multisector aid for basic social services,INT/UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons With Disabilities UNPRPD,INT/UN PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES UNPRPD,It is estimated that more than a billion people - about 15 % of the world's population - live with some form of disability. They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries.  The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world.  It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The  UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000  each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects.  Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by  the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education  has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %.  A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for  more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created.  Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is  also  member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.  Finland  has channelled 7.560.000 million euros to the partnership  (2012-2016) and will channel 15 million  in 2017.

The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.#4. The main objective and the expected results: #The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their childrens development.

El objetivo general de la intervención es contribuir a la mejora de la situación de salud de la población infantil saharaui de entre 3 y 6 años garantizando el correcto funcionamiento del programa de desayuno escolar al alumnado de las citadas guarderías. La problemática de los refugiados saharauis se remonta a hace más de 42 años, con la salida de España del territorio colonial y la anexión de este territorio por parte de Marruecos y Mauritania, lo que da inicio a una guerra entre el Frente POLISARIO y las dos potencias ocupantes. En el año 1991 se inicia un proceso de paz auspiciado por NN.UU. y que pone como condición la celebración de un referéndum para que el pueblo saharaui optara por continuar anexionado a Marruecos o por la autodeterminación. Este proceso se ha ido dilatando en el tiempo por los obstáculos puestos de manera continuada por el estado marroquí y por una falta de acuerdo entre las partes sobre el censo de votantes que participarían en el referéndum. Este estancamiento de la situación política ha llevado a que una gran parte de la población saharaui se vea confinada en los campamentos de refugiados de Tinduf, donde las condiciones de vida son especialmente duras. Los campamentos se encuentran situados en el sur de Argelia, en pleno desierto sahariano, en la conocida como Hammada, caracterizada por su ambiente árido y pedregoso, donde las temperaturas son extremas, llegando en el invierno a los 3º y en el verano a más de 50º. La escasez de agua y la aridez de la tierra hacen que sea muy difícil cualquier tipo de cultivo, por lo que la población depende de la ayuda humanitaria que distintas agencias internacionales distribuyen a las familias. La disminución de las ayudas internacionales que se ha producido en los últimos años ha redundado en una reducción considerable de los productos entregados. Actualmente la canasta básica aporta 2.000 Kcal/diarias por persona, lo que está por debajo de las 2.100 Kcal que recomienda la OMS para garantizar índices de nutrición adecuados. Ante esta situación se identifican determinados grupos de población en condiciones de especial vulnerabilidad en un contexto como el descrito, como es la población infantil, que con la actual cantidad de alimentos distribuida se ven abocados a una situación de desnutrición que afecta a su desarrollo físico e intelectual. Para paliar en la medida de lo posible esta situación, el proyecto pretende complementar la dieta que reciben los niños y niñas de entre 3 y 6 años con la distribución de alimentos de alto nivel calórico y equilibrio nutricional que aporten variedad en la dieta de los menores.

The strain on an already weakened health system has been further compounded by the diphtheria outbreak in early 2018 that has now reached over 2,200 cases.2 In addition, 16 million people lack access to safe water.3 Children are the primary victims of this conflict: more than 6,000 have been verified as killed or maimed since the conflict began.4 Growing food insecurity, poor water and sanitation, and the spread of preventable diseases threaten millions more. 383,000 children under 5 are estimated to suffer from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and require treatment.5 The damage and closure of schools and health facilities threaten children's access to education and health services, which renders children vulnerable to various protection concerns including early marriage, forced recruitment and psychosocial distress. The impact of this war on children will potentially be felt for generations.Aligned to the Humanitarian Response Plan, UNICEF's Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) has decentralized operations, with five field offices managing interventions locally, together with implementing partners. With the collapse of public services, UNICEF improves access to primary healthcare by providing supplies, covering operational costs, monitoring and responding to communicable disease outbreaks. Community management of malnutrition remains essential, especially in hard-to-reach areas. UNICEF's WASH strategy is integrated with nutrition and food security targeting immediate needs and strengthening long-term resilience of communities. UNICEF ensures uninterrupted access to safe water through rehabilitation works, and support for sustainable local management of water systems. The WASH, health and C4D AWD/cholera prevention/response plan focuses on high-risk areas, diarrhea treatment, chlorination of water sources, rehabilitation of waste water systems and hygiene awareness. UNICEF targets most vulnerable children in conflict-affected governorates with interventions including victim assistance, family tracing/reunification, documentation of child rights violations, mine/explosive remnants of war risk education and psychosocial support (PSS). For education, whilst rehabilitation of damaged schools, establishment of temporary safe learning spaces and provision of learning/pedagogical kits to children to provide a conducive learning environment will continue.UNICEF publ",No gender component,Not screened,UNICEF - Children's Fund - PRT,United Nations Children's Fund,41122,41000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family, advocacy"

La majorité d'entre eux se sont retrouvés dans des conditions d'existence précaires liées à leur statut légal incertain, sans possibilité de protection sociale. Cette situation les a rendus lourdement dépendants de l'UNRWA pour la satisfaction de leurs besoins de première nécessité.Dans ce contexte opérationnel extrêmement difficile, l'UNRWA continue à s'adapter  et à innover afin de rencontrer les besoins essentiels des réfugiés palestiniens affectés par la crise syrienne pour lesquels l'agence onusienne reste le principal  et souvent seul -  fournisseur d'assistance. L'UNRWA compte sur ses structures existantes, ses chaines d'approvisionnement et ses capacités pour apporter une réponse efficace et efficiente à ces besoins spécifiques.En 2017, les besoins financiers de l'organisation en réponse à la crise syrienne s'élèvent à US$ 411 million. Les priorités stratégiques qui guident les opérations de l'UNRWA dans ce contexte sont : Preserving resilience through the provision of humanitarian assistance in the form of cash, food and relief items.  Providing a protective framework for Palestine refugees through helping mitigate their vulnerability by maintaining access to basic services, including education; health; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and livelihoods, and promoting respect for international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL).  Strengthening humanitarian capacity, coordination and management to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of emergency programme delivery.Le Syria Emergency Appeal 2017  couvre les besoins humanitaires causés par la crise syrienne non seulement en Syrie mais également dans les pays voisins : Liban et Jordanie (voir Annexe 6). Les ressources nécessaires se chiffrent à 60M US$ au Liban et 17.5M US$ en Jordanie. Les opérations prévoient assistance alimentaire, assistance en cash transfer, hébergement et autres interventions d'urgence. L'UNRWA a par exemple joué un rôle crucial en assurant aux enfants palestiniens réfugiés de Syrie en Jordanie et au Liban l'accès à une éducation de qualité. -- General purpose : La réponse de l'UNRWA vise à atténuer les vulnérabilités de PRS en Jordanie via trois composantes principales: santé, éducation et assistance   cash  .

It will work in two locations one in a poor Maputo suburban neighbourhood and the other in Marracuene district of the Maputo Province. It will attend and involve youth both in and out of school and it aims to reach in total around 8000 beneficiaries (direct and indirect). The project is based on the principle that everyone has the right to participate in social and economic development. Young people's participation in development is an essential element in poverty reduction and reducing inequalities. The project aims at increasing equality among the youth at community level (outcome) and contributing to a more equal and inclusive society at national level (long term impact). To succeed in this the project will ensure that all young people in the project areas have same opportunities to access the project benefits; this means e.g. inclusion of youth with disabilities of different religions sex and language. Through the participation in project activities the youth will be empowered and more prepared to engage itself with the development of their communities. Part of the activities are focused on improving school attendance through explanation classes and advocacy work. The expected outcome for this is to reduce school dropout rates especially among girls and youth with special educational needs. In addition the project will capacitate adults to support young people's life skills and participation. This will be done by training teachers CSO workers and activitists as well as organizing awareness raising events in the project implementation areas.,Significant gender component,No disability component,Suomen lasten ja nuorten säätiö,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

SABAQ ZARENDUK: POR EL DERECHO A LA EDUCACIÓN EN EL VALLE DE HUSHÉ :: El proyecto se va a llevar a cabo en diez escuelas de ocho poblados del valle de Hushe, distrito Ghanche, región de Baltistan, en la provincia del Gilgit-Baltistan, al norte de Pakistán.                                             El derecho a la educación no está garantizado en Baltistán. El elevado analfabetismo, el absentismo y abandono escolar temprano, su desigual distribución en función del género, la inexistencia de comunidad escolar y la ausencia de profesorado cualificado, disponible y motivado son los ejemplos más visibles de una oferta educativa escasa, discriminatoria y de mala calidad.                                                               Por ello el proyecto pretende extender y reforzar un nuevo modelo educativo en el Valle. Para ello se desarrollarán dos resultados con sus correspondientes actividades                         1. Fortalecimiento de la calidad de la educación asegurando la participación y el compromiso de los Comités de Educación y del profesorado en el Plan Educativo. Para ello se va a definir una política de igualdad de oportunidades a la hora de seleccionar al profesorado, se va a formar a dos profesoras en educación especial, se pagarán pluses económicos a 4 de los profesores y profesoras de mayor cualificación para garantizar su estabilidad en el proyecto, se construirán dos nuevas aulas para educación secundaria, se ofertarán 4 nuevas plazas para niños y niñas con discapacidad en un centro especializado, se ofertarán 6 becas dirigidas a mujeres para la realización de estudios superiores y se impartirán clases de refuerzo para la preparación de exámenes de acceso a estudios superiores.                                                         2.

There are very few schools for deaf in the whole country. In addition, special classes for deaf children exist in ordinary schools but after 4th grade they have to attend ordinary classes where the teachers usually do not have sign language skills. The project includes also complementary training courses for teachers working with deaf children and for education sector functionaries responsible for special education. The project works in cooperation with the local Association of the Deaf and the Ministry of Education. In addition, the project increases knowledge about deafness and looks for advocacy opportunities as well as contacts with deaf people and people interested in the work.

El Plan de Desarrollo Comunal de Bni Idder considera el impulso de Enseñanza Primaria y la mejora de su calidad como eje prioritario de actuación. El 74.5% de su población es analfabeta (59.8% hombres y 89.2% mujeres). Por ello, presenta índices ligeramente superiores al resto del país y de los más altos de la Provincia de Tetuán. Bni Idder tiene 12 escuelas de Primaria Públicas (3 Agrupaciones escolares): Tlata Bni Idder (343 alumn@s y 14 docentes; 6 h y 8 m), Takat Amer (244 alumn@s y 10 docentes:2 h y 8 m) y Esbab (175 alumn@s y 10 docentes: 5 h y 5 m). Todas ellas carecen de infraestructuras básicas (la existente en estado lamentable); debido al descuido de las autoridades en su mantenimiento. Estas escuelas situadas en douares diseminados en  montaña; con acceso muy dificultoso, en época lluviosa.  Las escuelas están apartadas de las viviendas (de alumnado y profesorado). Por ejemplo, el personal docente de Tlata Bni Idder se desplaza, diariamente, desde Tetuán en taxi; debido a inexistencia de autobuses directos. Las familias del alumnado son campesinas; y en un 75-85% son analfabetas. Esta dispersión geográfica no favorece la organización del funcionamiento de las escuelas. En la Comuna, únicamente existe una Asociación de padres y madres creada recientemente por el actual director. En general, la población necesita sensibilización para impulsar el acceso y la continuidad escolar. Las carencias materiales, formativas, institucionales y sociales existentes provocan un desinterés y desmotivación en el personal docente. Con este proyecto, se pretende mejorar las capacidades humanas y el sistema educativo en la Primaria de l@s niñ@s de Bni Idder a través de acciones relacionadas con: a) construcción/rehabilitación y dotación de infraestructuras básicas a 3 Escuelas, b) talleres de Alfabetización y  sensibilización sobre la importancia de la educación para desarrollo integral, empoderamiento y el compromiso de las partes implicadas (Instituciones Educativas, Comuna, Directores y personal docente, padres/madres, menores, douares) para mejorar la calidad educativa en el medio rural (reducción absentismo y abandono escolar, calidad en los contenidos y nivel de enseñanza), c) talleres y reuniones para activar/dinamizar/fortalecer las asociaciones de padres y madres (AMPAS) que se  conviertan en garantes y defensores de los derechos de sus hijos a la educación especialmente al acceso con calidad de la misma.&quot;",Principal gender component,Not screened,"",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"education, family, advocacy"

Project: 11819 Big Brother Big Sister 2. Project area and Country: Occupied Palestinian Territory (East Jerusalem) 3. Project justification: The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continues to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sectors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CBOs in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.4. The main objective and the expected results: The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk of dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relationship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers' (Big Brothers/Sisters) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in supporting their children's development. The project will also continue to expose and motivate the CBOs in East Jerusalem to participate in the Big Brother Big Sister programme.5.

Secondary Education,Secondary education,Empowered Girls Speak Out - Securing education of girls through sports in secondary schools and vocational training,EMPOWERED GIRLS SPEAK OUT - SECURING EDUCATION OF GIRLS THROUGH SPORTS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING,Empowered Girls Speak Out is a project aiming to empower adolescent girls aged 13-19 to understand their rights encourage equal education and promote freedom from gender-based violence. While girls are the center of social change local communities will also be targeted to facilitate girl empowerment. The project will initially work with eight communities in two districts Mtwara Municipal and Mtwara Rural. These communities were chosen with local education and health authorities who highlighted the low secondary school attendance poor academic performance and high teenage pregnancy rates of girls in these communities. Through a participatory process with adolescent girls we then established the reasons and viable solutions to these problems.The central issue to be addressed is poor academic performance which according to girls themselves is due to critical reasons such as; gender-based violence; harassment in and on the way to school; negative parental attitudes towards girls? education due to traditional gender norms; lack of positive female role models; and girls? low expectations of employability after education. Furthermore insufficient knowledge of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) combined with traditional cultural practices of encouraging adolescent sexual relations and a lack of contraceptives is leading to many school-aged pregnancies.The project will work with young girls schools and key stakeholders in the communities. Girls? Action Clubs (GACs) will provide a safe space for both in and out of school girls to share experiences and learn essential life skills and SRHR. 50 peer leaders and 24 adult tutors will be trained for GACs. GACs will utilise sports drama and dance to attract members but the main focus will be on providing training & education for their participants.Special education will be emphasised to the Unyago which is a training for young girls (6-13 year of age) about household activities and how to treat future husbands properly. Unyago training is one main reason why young girls get pregnant at early age and drop out from school. Contents of Unyago will also be revitalised with Unyago trainers.,Principal gender component,Not screened,Liikunnan kehitysyhteistyö Liike ry,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family, advocacy"

Research has found that these microorganisms, known as gut microbiota, play an important role in the development and normal function of our immune and nervous systems. This project will offer important insights into how antibiotics might disrupt gut microbiota and affect brain function in young children.Brain chemistry and antibioticsRecent evidence in animal models suggests that gut microbiota can influence brain chemistry, which can affect behaviour. However, we do not know how this occurs. We also do not know how the disruption of normal gut microbiota early in life from antibiotic use, for example, might influence brain development and potentially contribute to behavioural and/or mood disorders. This project will seek to offer some answers. The research team will aim to:-understand the mechanisms underpinning the microbiome-gut-brain axis and the potential contribution of gut microbiota disruption to neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders-determine the long-term impact of early life disruption of the gut microbiota on brain chemistry and behaviour related to anxiety and social interaction-delineate immune mechanisms linking the altered microbiota to behavioural changes-identify potentially novel components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis related to antibiotic effects on brain function and behaviour-further develop the training environment and collaborative research among the partnersUnderstanding the gut-brain linkThe successful completion of this project will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the connection between gut bacteria and the brain.

This project will provide insight into circuit formation to help us understand how axon regeneration can improve clinical outcomes. Brain wiring, damage, and developmental defects Researchers have suggested that improper wiring of the nervous system is the basis for some neurodevelopmental defects. What are the mechanisms that guarantee the proper wiring between the billions of neurons during brain development? Molecules in the extracellular environment, called guidance cues, guide axons to their targets. These cues can be attractive, pulling axons in the right direction, or repulsive, which means they prevent axons from navigating to incorrect targets. Other conditions in which axons need to navigate in adults include regeneration after mechanical or degenerative stimuli, such as a spinal cord injury. Proper regeneration in adults is still a significant clinical problem. Project objectives This research project aims to: -generate a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the nervous system's wiring -identify novel strategies to promote the proper guidance and wiring of the nervous system -further develop the graduate training environment and international research collaboration among the partners This work will shed new light on the mechanisms that govern the wiring of the nervous system and their role in axon regeneration.

A special reason for continuing the project is that after 20 years the programstaff wants to update the service policy and develop a strategic plan. Therefore besides treatments and guidance the work history and actual working environments are reflected carefully. The staff collects their observations data andknowledge in order to develop a new model. They will combine experience of client-centred work to the community oriented practice. It is not easy because the community and the children there are in turmoil. Through the collective effortto understand how to best shape the service the staff and administration will develop a strategic plan for mental health services. ?Best service for the most needy people? is the motto of the mental health program of NISCVT. The strategic planning process addresses gender equality reducing inequality climate sustainability as well as questions of financial institutional social and ecological sustainabily. These are not new issues but placed in the new frame. NISCVT sees health as a human rights question issue. This is the basis of the service from prevention promotion treatment and rehabilitation to how to help each child deal with their difficulties.,Significant gender component,Not screened,Finnish-Arab Friendship Society,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Principal,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"education, family, advocacy"

The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers. Estimated number of children is 370-420 of them 60-80 children with special needs.,Significant gender component,Not screened,Psychologists for Social Responsibility,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Principal,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"education, family"

They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries. The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world. It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects. Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %. A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created. Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is also member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee.

Tanzanian children in Tanga and Mwanza dream about a childhood that will equip them for life in which they can become all that they can be. In order to reach their full potential they desire a childhood free from exclusion, malnourishment, poverty, abuse, neglect, physical and intellectual boundaries, rape and various other challenges. The only way to reach that dream is to give them a chance by involving them and allowing them to participate and become agents of change in community development. FPCT and Fida have had community interventions with Youth with Disabilities Community Programme (YDCP) in Tanga. The programme was started in 2004 in order to address disability challenges and continues to support children with disabilities as well as act as a flagship initiative for disability issues in Tanzania and all over East Africa. Another development intervention of FPCT is in Mwanza where together with Fida they have a long history of working with orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). There has been a transition from supporting one individual child into meeting the needs of the entire community through community-based approach. Work in Mwanza has been recognized nationally for its impact on children's empowerment and issues of improved food security in Mwanza region. The programme purpose is to have communities actively involved in the holistic development of children in Tanga and Mwanza. The programme consists of 3 components. Component 1 in Tanga, Component 2 in Mwanza and Component 3 for Horizontal learning. The horizontal learning component is a peer-to-peer learning initiative. Under this programme local governments and communities from Tanga and Mwanza connect with each other to identify, share, and replicate the very best practices in order to experience positive transformation in communities. This programme is directly contributing to the realisation of children's full-potential in Tanzania by involving the communities to help children access their participation rights, protection rights and survival and development rights as mandated by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The desired long-term impact is that the human rights violations against children will decrease in Tanga and Mwanza.",Significant gender component,Not screened,Fida International ry,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

However, in recent studies, pollution has been associated with variety diseases of the CNS, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The insect models will allow more cost efficient access to toxicity profiling and thereby potentially increase the number of tests performed.

If diagnosed and treated, around 80% of children can survive, but more than 25% will suffer long-term neurological consequences, such as impaired cognition and motor function, and epilepsy. In developing countries in Asia and Latin America, perinatal complications such as birth asphyxia have overtaken communicable diseases as the principal causes of morbidity in children under five.In each of these leading causes of death and disability, a key factor is impaired oxygen delivery to the brain. Neurological damage due to insufficient oxygen delivery is made more likely due to the increased metabolic demand which occurs during seizure activity, which is a common occurrence amongst those suffering from brain injury, and can itself be a source of further traumatic brain injury.The lack of low-cost portable instrumentation for neurological monitoring of neonates and children in the developing world restricts our ability to diagnose and monitor the progression of such diseases, to effectively develop new treatments, and to target the use of scarce rehabilitatory resources.To satisfy this unmet need, I propose the development and implementation of an accessible technology which is capable of measuring blood flow and oxygenation status with high spatial resolution, unique in providing a non-invasive, low-cost and portable means to study and monitor the progression of diseases such as cerebral malaria, and the encephalopathies which result from perinatal complications.",No gender component,Not screened,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think?tank","University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,51000,Significant,potential false positive,Not inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,Not education,Not family,Not advocacy,Other,""

The violence between armed groups and government forces has displaced over 3 million people from their homes. The capacity of the Government to respond to the basic needs of its citizens has been overwhelmed. While Daesh has lost considerable territory in 2016, it is expected that humanitarian needs will remain significant in the coming years. More people will be displaced by the conflict, while many will remain displaced in camps and host communities. However, there will also be growing numbers of people returning to areas no longer under the control of Daesh who will also need assistance to help restart their lives.With GAC's support, Handicap International Canada is improving the accessibility of physical rehabilitation, psychosocial support services and community awareness of environmental risks for vulnerable conflict-affected Iraqis. Project activities include: (1) providing physical and functional rehabilitation services, and psychosocial support services to people with functional limitations, psychosocial distress and their caregivers; (2) providing training, equipment and assistive devices to local structures providing physical rehabilitation services; (3) conducting awareness activities on chemical weapons (CW) and improvised explosive devices (IED); and (4) improving the accessibility of local structures./ Décembre 2016  La situation humanitaire en Irak continue de se dégrader.

La demande a dépassé la capacité du gouvernement à combler les besoins de base de ses citoyens. Bien que Daesh ait perdu en 2016 une partie considérable du territoire qu'il avait conquis, on s'attend à ce que les besoins humanitaires demeurent importants dans les prochaines années. Davantage de gens seront déplacés par le conflit, alors que bon nombre d'autres personnes déjà déplacées demeureront dans des camps et dans leur collectivité d'accueil.

The violence between armed groups and government forces has displaced over 3 million people from their homes. The capacity of the Government to respond to the basic needs of its citizens has been overwhelmed. While Daesh has lost considerable territory in 2016, it is expected that humanitarian needs will remain significant in the coming years. More people will be displaced by the conflict, while many will remain displaced in camps and host communities. However, there will also be growing numbers of people returning to areas no longer under the control of Daesh who will also need assistance to help restart their lives.With GAC's support, Handicap International Canada is improving the accessibility of physical rehabilitation, psychosocial support services and community awareness of environmental risks for vulnerable conflict-affected Iraqis.

En este contexto los proyectos que se realizan en Cuba tienen buena acogida, y lo que es más importante, continuidad en el tiempo ya que están dirigidos a necesidades detectadas, concretas y se interviene de forma integral con el resto de instituciones y organismos con los que colaboramos en el territorio.La Universidad de Valencia brinda la oportunidad a las asociaciones estudiantiles de realizar Proyectos de Cooperación al Desarrollo en países de América Latina. El presente proyecto tiene dos ejes claros e interrelacionados entre sí: la dotación de recursos e intercambio cultural con una Escuela Primaria en Cuba, y el desarrollo cultural y social de los niños cubanos. Este proyecto no es sólo una acción concreta en un país con necesidades especiales, sino un ejemplo de que es necesario el intercambio y la cooperación, bien sea en trasladar material educativo y potenciar una escuela primaria, o como lo es propio en la academia el intercambio del conocimiento.",Significant gender component,Not screened,ACONTRACORRENT,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,Not inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,Education,education

Tteaching language in secondary schools is mainly English and the deaf are not offered any help in interpretation. A significant number of deaf pupils drop out from school due to the lack of opportunities to study effectively; consequently they find it extremely challenging to find employment. The main goal of the project is to improve the opportunities for deaf pupils to increase their chances to complete the secondary education. The Deaf Unit at Meru Primary School (MPS) in Arusha is chosen to receive a specific information technology targeted learning environment. This enhancement is achieved by supporting continuing training for teachers and developing the skills of all pupils in information technology data searching data processing and in the English language.An important aspect of the technological learning environment is the learning centre. The data projector all computers and room lighting are powered by solar energy. The centre will introduce information technology clubs training for teachers/student teachers as well as classroom teaching. To support and maintain the educational and technical infrastructure two persons with both IT and sign language skills will be employed.The beneficiaries are the deaf young people including those who have dropped out from education and local young IT supportive teams. This project and its unique training support will also benefit the area?s teachers by providing IT expertise to the teachers at MPS and other educational staff around Arusha in turn enabling them all to offer the most appropriate learning environment for disadvantaged children. Those studying at the Patandi Teachers? College will gain experience in practice. Thus the target of effectively teaching deaf children can be further enhanced and improved.This project will support the rights of the young disabled and socially displaced minorities. Also gender equality will be effectuated by implementing the new teaching method to more female pupils. At present the deaf female/male pupil ratio in MPS is 36/43. With the new tuition method the numbers of female pupils entering secondary education will most likely see a significant increase.The Arusha Special Needs Education Coordinator the headmaster of MPS and FSE ry has jointly developed this project. All above organisations will implement the project mutually.,Significant gender component,Not screened,Suomen erityiskasvatuksen liitto ry,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

Approximately 50% of children remain out of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend due to the lack of inclusiveness. With support from Serve the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive & Child Friendly Education Policy in order to ensure access to and quality of education for all children regardless their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances. The MoE has already begun trainings in Inclusive Education (IE) in several areas in Afghanistan including Nangahar province.SHIP school was established in 1991 to serve the educational needs of deaf children. The school later expanded to educating children with intellectual disabilities and then recently in 2012 we began our reverse inclusion where the disabled and non-disabled children could be educated together in the same classroom. Many said this would not be possible. However SHIP has proven that it is possible. Serve's goal from its beginning has been to create inclusive communities. We now believe the community is ready to begin handover of the SHIP school to the MoE as an example of inclusive education. In order to make this a reality we will work with students parents community and other relevant stakeholders to begin advocacy with the government to take complete responsibility for the education of the students. We believe this is possible because the government has already taken the responsibility for other special schools. To accomplish the objective of SHIP handover the following steps will be taken:1. Preparation of MoE schools by implementing Serve Inclusive Education (IE) model2. Preparation of SHIP students for inclusion in the prepared inclusive MoE schools. 3. Preparation of SHIP teachers parents and community for the handover4. Ensure normal and smooth operation of SHIP during the transitional periodWe will gradually release responsibility to the government after they have been trained and equipped with the necessary skills and tools to provide sustainable and quality education for all students. After the handover Serve will continue to follow-up and support the inclusive MoE schools through the CBR (Community-based Rehabilitation) function of SHIP capacity of which will be increased to support increased number of clients.,Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Operaatio Mobilisaatio ry",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family"

The objective of the project was to strengthen the support system and increase inclusion of children with disabilities and learning difficulties. The support system for children with disabilities in Kosovo is weak and this project aimed at strengthening it. KAPIE has successfully managed the last year?s project so the Embassy has decided to continue the support for ?Support to Inclusive Education Reform 2015? with the same activities but widening them into 34 new primary schools.

Estas escuelas situadas en douares diseminados en  montaña; con acceso muy dificultoso, en época lluviosa.  Las escuelas están apartadas de las viviendas (de alumnado y profesorado). Por ejemplo, el personal docente de Tlata Bni Idder se desplaza, diariamente, desde Tetuán en taxi; debido a inexistencia de autobuses directos.

Secondary Education,Secondary education,Empowered Girls Speak Out - Securing education of girls through sports in secondary schools and vocational training,EMPOWERED GIRLS SPEAK OUT - SECURING EDUCATION OF GIRLS THROUGH SPORTS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING,Empowered Girls Speak Out is a project aiming to empower adolescent girls aged 13-19 to understand their rights encourage equal education and promote freedom from gender-based violence. While girls are the center of social change local communities will also be targeted to facilitate girl empowerment. The project will initially work with eight communities in two districts Mtwara Municipal and Mtwara Rural. These communities were chosen with local education and health authorities who highlighted the low secondary school attendance poor academic performance and high teenage pregnancy rates of girls in these communities. Through a participatory process with adolescent girls we then established the reasons and viable solutions to these problems.The central issue to be addressed is poor academic performance which according to girls themselves is due to critical reasons such as; gender-based violence; harassment in and on the way to school; negative parental attitudes towards girls? education due to traditional gender norms; lack of positive female role models; and girls? low expectations of employability after education. Furthermore insufficient knowledge of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) combined with traditional cultural practices of encouraging adolescent sexual relations and a lack of contraceptives is leading to many school-aged pregnancies.The project will work with young girls schools and key stakeholders in the communities. Girls? Action Clubs (GACs) will provide a safe space for both in and out of school girls to share experiences and learn essential life skills and SRHR. 50 peer leaders and 24 adult tutors will be trained for GACs. GACs will utilise sports drama and dance to attract members but the main focus will be on providing training & education for their participants.Special education will be emphasised to the Unyago which is a training for young girls (6-13 year of age) about household activities and how to treat future husbands properly. Unyago training is one main reason why young girls get pregnant at early age and drop out from school.

Neurodevelopmental disorders have previously been neglected due to more challenging health problems, e.g., under 5 mortality. However, CP is a common cause of movement disability and it has a devastating impact on the child and its family affecting occupational activities, social relationships, psychological well-being and financial conditions. We plan to perform a randomized controlled study comparing clusters of villages with the community based program to villages maintaining the ordinary health services. However, before commencing the intervention we need to understand the panorama of CP in Uganda. There is little information available about the epidemiology of CP in Sub-Saharan Africa. We are currently studying a hospital cohort at Mulago University Hospital in Kampala, but there are obvious limitations. Therefore, we plan to perform a population-based epidemiology study on CP at the Iganga DSS, in which we will explore the prevalence, type of CP, severity level, associated risk factors as well as available rehabilitative and therapeutic services. The subsequent intervention study will be performed on this cohort of children. The information and the results from this project will be useful for advocacy purposes and aiding policy makers allocate adequate resources for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities.",No gender component,Not screened,Karolinska Institutet,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank",51000,51000,Principal,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"education, family"

This project will provide insight into circuit formation to help us understand how axon regeneration can improve clinical outcomes. Brain wiring, damage, and developmental defects Researchers have suggested that improper wiring of the nervous system is the basis for some neurodevelopmental defects. What are the mechanisms that guarantee the proper wiring between the billions of neurons during brain development? Molecules in the extracellular environment, called guidance cues, guide axons to their targets. These cues can be attractive, pulling axons in the right direction, or repulsive, which means they prevent axons from navigating to incorrect targets. Other conditions in which axons need to navigate in adults include regeneration after mechanical or degenerative stimuli, such as a spinal cord injury. Proper regeneration in adults is still a significant clinical problem. Project objectives This research project aims to: -generate a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the nervous system's wiring -identify novel strategies to promote the proper guidance and wiring of the nervous system -further develop the graduate training environment and international research collaboration among the partners This work will shed new light on the mechanisms that govern the wiring of the nervous system and their role in axon regeneration. It could help to identify novel strategies to promote proper guidance and wiring in the neural circuits of abnormally developing axons, or damaged and regenerating axons.

Research has found that these microorganisms, known as gut microbiota, play an important role in the development and normal function of our immune and nervous systems. This project will offer important insights into how antibiotics might disrupt gut microbiota and affect brain function in young children.Brain chemistry and antibioticsRecent evidence in animal models suggests that gut microbiota can influence brain chemistry, which can affect behaviour. However, we do not know how this occurs. We also do not know how the disruption of normal gut microbiota early in life from antibiotic use, for example, might influence brain development and potentially contribute to behavioural and/or mood disorders. This project will seek to offer some answers. The research team will aim to:-understand the mechanisms underpinning the microbiome-gut-brain axis and the potential contribution of gut microbiota disruption to neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders-determine the long-term impact of early life disruption of the gut microbiota on brain chemistry and behaviour related to anxiety and social interaction-delineate immune mechanisms linking the altered microbiota to behavioural changes-identify potentially novel components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis related to antibiotic effects on brain function and behaviour-further develop the training environment and collaborative research among the partnersUnderstanding the gut-brain linkThe successful completion of this project will provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the connection between gut bacteria and the brain. It will provide insight into the gut microbiota disruption's potential contribution to the development of mood and behavioural disorders. This knowledge may help researchers develop novel approaches to maintaining mental health.Project leadershipThe project lead is Paul Forsythe at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.

Project wants to highlight the child's right to get quality mental health service when in need due to some mental health behavior or developmental disturbance. This is done in partnership with Beddawi and Nahr el-Bared Family Guidance Centers (FGC) of Beit Atfal Assumoud. According to the parents children in previous phase of the project have gained Improved language/communication skills autonomy and self-confidence cognitive and motor progress reading and writing skills daily living skills social skills and less distracted and more attentive behavior.The continuation of the project is based on the notion that especially concerning the children with multiple disabilities time and patience is needed in their treatment setting. The child with disabilities needs a lot of rehearsal and repetition before he/she has learned the new skill permanently. The result in the project is the children's better wellbeing and new skills gained in treament and special education. In cooperation with family and duty bearers right to quality service will come up. Cross-cutting objectives are challenged in all activities especially children's own reactions to the serious principles will be listened.

Lebanon has launched the Crisis Response Plan to find the stabilizing ingredients in every action. The project Developing the children's mental health and special services in ongoing crisis responds to the long-term problem the marginalisation of Palestinian refugees in host country and the hardships of the poor families. Normal services are not only actual service but recognition to the right to exist to enjoy the civil rights to gain resources for decent life. Annually hundreds of Palestinian children have got high quality help and families relieved when seeing the progress of the child. BAS proceeded to take seriously the right to education of the children with intellectual and psychological disabilities. Because of the staff's negotiations with special schools small number of institutions offering places for Palestinian children has already increased to almost 40. It is a break through: Palestinian children with disabilities are visible now. In all actions the sustainability was respected in human environment and ecologically. Concerning gender boys were major beneficiaries but the prevalence of disability of boys in young age is more than of girls. The main partner is Finnish Arab Friendship Society which works also to support the families by sponsorship program and for children's mental health. FiPSR works in South Lebanon FAFS in North Lebanon. There are 5 partners of BAS with whom Finnish NGOs are in continuous contact. The beneficiaries are 260 children with disturbancies in mental health behavior and development new referrals to the Family Guidance Centers and ca 400 children who continue in treatment. The formerly separate disability project which was pioneer in its field is now included in the new project. 60 children with multiple special needs (disabilities) will benefit from special education and rehabilitation.

Pauvreté et handicap s'additionnent et augmentent la vulnérabilité et l'exclusion.La stratégie opérationnelle du programme se décline dans les secteurs dans lesquels HI a bâti une expérience solide : Sécurité routièreSanté maternelle et infantileRéadaptation à base communautaireRéadaptationInsertion professionnelleAppui aux associationsSPECIFIC RESULTS:  Résultat 1: Les facteurs de risque des déficiences intellectuelles sont mieux connus et pris en compte par la population et par les services de santé de la province de Pinar del Rio. Pour parvenir à atteindre notre objectif, il est important que la population acquière une meilleure connaissance du handicap mais aussi des causes fondamentales liées à ce type de handicap (les facteurs périnataux sont une des causes principales du handicap intellectuel). Il est aussi nécessaire d'informer la population à travers des campagnes massives (spots télévisés/ brochures) mais aussi de préparer le personnel médical qui, centré sur la survie de la mère et du nouveau-né, ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences de certaines pratiques sur les conditions de vie de ces personnes dans le futur, ou minimise certains facteurs de risque.Résultat 2 Les services de diagnostic, orientation, et stimulation précoce ont des compétences actualisées sur la problématique liée à la déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde. Afin d'appuyer les familles à faire face à ce type de handicap, mais aussi permettre à l'enfant ou au jeune une évolution vers une plus grande autonomie, il est important de coordonner tous les efforts et les expertises existantes dans le pays, au service d'un programme d'appui aux parents au sein de leur communauté. C'est pourquoi il est prévu de créer un groupe opérationnel multisectoriel au niveau provincial, qui s'appuiera sur un groupe municipal. Ce groupe intégré par des professionnels pourra alors promouvoir la détection et la stimulation précoce pour agir le plus vite possible, mais aussi renforcer le diagnostic psychopédagogique afin qu'il soit fait de façon plus intégral et précis. Le projet s'appuiera également sur le réseau d'agents communautaires existants, crée dans la cadre du projet RBC précédent, pour le renforcer, afin qu'ils puissent guider les parents dans ce processus de réadaptation.Résultat 3 : Les familles d'enfants et adolescents vivant avec une déficience intellectuelle sévère et profonde sont mieux préparées pour favoriser l'autonomie et/ou améliorer leur qualité de vie. Le projet prétend mettre en place un programme intégral, avec des outils à destination des familles (et donc adapté à leur contexte culturel), qui doivent les aider à accompagner la personne de leur famille avec handicap intellectuel dans son évolution vers une plus grande autonomie et une meilleure intégration sociale.

Government & Civil Society-general,Human rights,INT/UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons With Disabilities UNPRPD,INT/UN PARTNERSHIP TO PROMOTE THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES UNPRPD,It is estimated that more than a billion people - about 15 % of the world's population - live with some form of disability. They experience higher rates of poverty less legal protection lower educational achievements poorer health outcomes and less policitical and cultural participation among others particularly in lower income countries. The UNPRPD Partnership brings together the UN system (UNDP UNICEF ILO WHO UNDESA OHCHR UNFPA UNESCO UN Women) governments Disabled Persons Organizations and the broader civil society to advance disability rights around the world. It operates through a Multi-Partner Trust Fund managed by the UNDP. The UNPRPD aims at developing the capacities of national stakeholders particularly governments and organizations of persons with disabilities for the effective implementation of the CRPD (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) including through promoting disability-inclusive internationally agreed development goals. This will happen by mainstreaming the disability rights within the UN system and by financing local or global projects and involve targeted as well as mainstreamed approaches (350.000 ? each). The involvement of government civil society and UN Country Teams ensure the quality relevance and sustainability of the projects. Round 1 projects are showing promising results by promoting the rights of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities by the establishment of Ombudsman for Psychiatry and promotion of de-institutionalization in Moldova. In Togo inclusive education has increased the enrollment rates of disabled children by 132 %. A National Charter for the Rights or Persons with Disabilities was developed and it generated formal commitments in Tunisia. Also a network of Inclusive Cities with official public commitment to their budgets was created in Indonesia. Legal assistance is provided for more than 1000 disabled persons in Vietnam and 60 DPO's have received training on the rights of disabled persons and policy advocacy techniques. In Costa Rica job opportunities and self-employment activities were created. Finland is the biggest donor government followed by Australia and she is also member of the UNPRPD Policy Board and Management Committee. Finland has channelled 7.560.000 million euros to the partnership (2012-2016).

It supported 15 service-providers in five Sub-Saharan countries by providing them with technological and clinical support as well as advice to foster the social inclusion of the targeted people.This project during its implementation period, in Madagascar, Tanzania, Togo, Zambia and Somalia supported a total of 9 government- and privately-run physical rehabilitation centres, and 2 institutes that trained physical rehabilitation professionals. Between 2015 and 2016, in these five countries, this contributed to the provision of physical rehabilitation services to some 37,000 people. In 2016 the number of persons with disabilities receiving services increased compared to 2015 with 22,000 people, including nearly 9,000 women and 14,000 children. Governments, particularly health ministries (MoH), began to see the importance of having national platforms for advocating policies to strengthen their country's physical rehabilitation sector. Especially, Madagascar, Tanzania and Togo established such platforms, which comprised representatives from the government, providers of physical rehabilitation services, training institutions, DPOs, and Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The project in order to ensure the sustainability of partners signed Agreements (MoU) with MoH (in Madagascar, Tanzania, Togo), developed national plan and policy platform (in Madagascar, Tanzania, Togo), MoU signed with key partners (in Somali Rec Crescent Society), and proposed MoU to Zambian MoH. For improving the quality of physical rehabilitation service, the project provided training to 591 number of professionals including: management trainings (112 persons), clinical P&O and PT trainings (244 persons), mother of children with cerebral palsy (179 mothers), OADCPH training (56 persons). The project also included On-line training (joint ICRC MoveAbility Physiopaedia on-line worldwide training) to over 800 persons, renovation of teaching facilities (ENAM institute) in Togo, as well as creating of a regional training facility in Tanzania. Despite this progress, governments worldwide still need to step up their efforts to take the lead in establishing or presiding over these platforms, and to create entities within their health ministries for overseeing the physical rehabilitation sector. They also need to bolster the development of national plans for physical rehabilitation, whether separately or as part of a broader plan for addressing non-communicable diseases.",Not screened,Not screened,"","",,,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,Not advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education"

Tanzanian children in Tanga and Mwanza dream about a childhood that will equip them for life in which they can become all that they can be. In order to reach their full potential they desire a childhood free from exclusion, malnourishment, poverty, abuse, neglect, physical and intellectual boundaries, rape and various other challenges. The only way to reach that dream is to give them a chance by involving them and allowing them to participate and become agents of change in community development. FPCT and Fida have had community interventions with Youth with Disabilities Community Programme (YDCP) in Tanga. The programme was started in 2004 in order to address disability challenges and continues to support children with disabilities as well as act as a flagship initiative for disability issues in Tanzania and all over East Africa. Another development intervention of FPCT is in Mwanza where together with Fida they have a long history of working with orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). There has been a transition from supporting one individual child into meeting the needs of the entire community through community-based approach. Work in Mwanza has been recognized nationally for its impact on children's empowerment and issues of improved food security in Mwanza region. The programme purpose is to have communities actively involved in the holistic development of children in Tanga and Mwanza. The programme consists of 3 components. Component 1 in Tanga, Component 2 in Mwanza and Component 3 for Horizontal learning. The horizontal learning component is a peer-to-peer learning initiative. Under this programme local governments and communities from Tanga and Mwanza connect with each other to identify, share, and replicate the very best practices in order to experience positive transformation in communities. This programme is directly contributing to the realisation of children's full-potential in Tanzania by involving the communities to help children access their participation rights, protection rights and survival and development rights as mandated by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC). The desired long-term impact is that the human rights violations against children will decrease in Tanga and Mwanza.",Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Fida International",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

Esto como estrategia para reunir todo lo referente al trabajo con comunidades vulnerables en Bogotá, siendo parte muy importante de ello. El Hogar Santa María de los Robles está ubicado en el barrio Caracolí,  al sur de la ciudad de Bogotá, en Colombia. El Hogar tuvo su origen en el año 2003, a partir de las visitas realizadas por ?Religiosas Esclavas del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús? y el acompañamiento de personas voluntarias, al barrio Caracolí, hechas a familias con miembros en condición de discapacidad física, cognitiva, social y mental. En estas visitas se detectaron las condiciones de vida de las familias, así como factores de vulnerabilidad: salud, educación, vivienda y socio-culturales a las que se veían expuestas. Cuidad Bolívar se ha caracterizado desde hace mucho tiempo como el espacio que tiene más familias desplazadas por la violencia, por la pobreza y el abandono. En Ciudad Bolívar, existe un alto número de quebradas sin canalizar, las cuales se convierten en focos de enfermedades. En Caracolí, viven las personas más pobres, sin alguna pertenencia, cargan sobre sus hombros una vida paupérrima, una pobreza intelectual, social y emocional grande y un gran número de personas con discapacidad física y/o mental. Mujeres cuyos sueños se han desvanecido. Son y se sienten que no valen nada, ignorantes, tristes, deprimidas, invisibles, dependientes de la pobreza, de ojos sin brillo, sin orgullo, mujeres maltratadas en mente, cuerpo, alma y espíritu.Objetivos y actividades: Contribuir a la inclusión social de la población diversamente hábil del estrato socio económico 0 y 1, facilitándoles el acceso a un proceso de atención integral de terapias: física, ocupacional, educación especial, fonoaudiología, musical, desarrollo de hábitos y habilidades para el día a día.

Estarán hechas de cemento y ladrillos con una base elevada cubierta de láminas, para evitar la entrada de serpientes y escorpiones. Una vivienda de estas características está provista de las condiciones necesarias de salubridad, constituyendo un resguardo eficaz ante las inclemencias del clima, y proporcionando un ambiente familiar limpio y digno. Todo ello repercutirá en el desarrollo integral de la familia.Beneficiarios directos: La población beneficiaría directa son 28 personas discapacitadas, 10 mujeres y 18 hombres más sus familias, que con una media de 4 personas por familia son un total de 112 personas beneficiarías directas. Los terrenos de las viviendas se inscribirán a nombre de las personas con discapacidad de la familia como primer paso para promover su empoderamiento socio-económico.Las edades van desde los 15 hasta los 48 años, y por tipo de discapacidad, 11 tienen diferentes grados de discapacidad física, 5 discapacidad múltiple, 3 discapacidad intelectual, 5 personas son discapacitados/as auditivas y 4 son personas con discapacidad visual.Beneficiarios indirectos: Al ser un proyecto comunitario y no meramente puntual, los beneficiarios indirectos se extienden en general a las comunidades rurales implicadas, 22.025 personas, y en particular a los miembros de los shangams de personas con discapacidad de las aldeas (163 personas).",No gender component,Not screened,Vicente Ferrer Foundation,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Principal,No,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,Not education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"family, advocacy"

En 2015, tras valorar la incidencia que se está teniendo, seguimos profundizando con las organizaciones municipales en colaboración con dos asociaciones feministas centroamericanas: Mujeres Transformando (El Salvador) y La Cuerda (Guatemala); daremos continuidad al trabajo en los centros educativos que más se han implicado de los que se han sumado en el proyecto en ejecución, sin perder la continuidad con el centro de educación especial de Castro del Río; y se garantiza el uso de los espacios públicos necesarios contando con todas las bibliotecas como eje de transmisión de conocimiento.En este proyecto el objetivo es informar, comprometer y dotar de capacidad de movilización a la ciudadanía andaluza para detectar y enfrentar los micromachismos, trabajándolo específicamente, con centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones públicas municipales de Córdoba, Sevilla, Málaga y Jaén.El primer resultado se basa en consolidar la red de trabajo de centros educativos, colectivos e instituciones de ocho municipios andaluces y dos organizaciones feministas centroamericanas, para trabajar, generar sinergias e intercambiar experiencias.El segundo resultado se centra en el trabajo con los centros educativos mediante la ejecución de la nueva unidad didáctica que recoge las lecciones aprendidas en el proceso y propone un encuentro de los centros para intercambiar experiencias, evaluar y darle continuidad.El tercer resultado es fruto del trabajo realizado con los colectivos que avanzarán en la formación en género junto con las dos organizaciones centroamericanas, para ello se organizarán unas jornadas en las que planificaremos colectivamente el trabajo que luego realizaremos con cada colectivo para editar una herramienta audiovisual y realizar una campaña de incidencia en el municipio que desenmascare los micromachismos y defienda los derechos de las mujeres.El cuarto resultado se centra en fortalecer la capacidad de incidencia de centros educativos, colectivos  y bibliotecas en Córdoba, Sevilla, Málaga y Jaén mediante la dotación de recursos: envío de materiales educativos, incorporación de artículos en la revista Pueblos sobre Centroamérica y África subsahariana; diseño, edición, publicación y muestra de una exposición fotográfica sobre los derechos de las mujeres en colaboración con La Cuerda; y participación en medios de comunicación.",Principal gender component,Not screened,,Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,Not family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, advocacy"

Tteaching language in secondary schools is mainly English and the deaf are not offered any help in interpretation. A significant number of deaf pupils drop out from school due to the lack of opportunities to study effectively; consequently they find it extremely challenging to find employment. The main goal of the project is to improve the opportunities for deaf pupils to increase their chances to complete the secondary education. The Deaf Unit at Meru Primary School (MPS) in Arusha is chosen to receive a specific information technology targeted learning environment. This enhancement is achieved by supporting continuing training for teachers and developing the skills of all pupils in information technology data searching data processing and in the English language.An important aspect of the technological learning environment is the learning centre. The data projector all computers and room lighting are powered by solar energy. The centre will introduce information technology clubs training for teachers/student teachers as well as classroom teaching. To support and maintain the educational and technical infrastructure two persons with both IT and sign language skills will be employed.The beneficiaries are the deaf young people including those who have dropped out from education and local young IT supportive teams. This project and its unique training support will also benefit the area?s teachers by providing IT expertise to the teachers at MPS and other educational staff around Arusha in turn enabling them all to offer the most appropriate learning environment for disadvantaged children. Those studying at the Patandi Teachers? College will gain experience in practice. Thus the target of effectively teaching deaf children can be further enhanced and improved.This project will support the rights of the young disabled and socially displaced minorities. Also gender equality will be effectuated by implementing the new teaching method to more female pupils. At present the deaf female/male pupil ratio in MPS is 36/43. With the new tuition method the numbers of female pupils entering secondary education will most likely see a significant increase.The Arusha Special Needs Education Coordinator the headmaster of MPS and FSE ry has jointly developed this project.

Additionally, themes such as environmental issues, social aspects of the hiv and aids -pandemia and gender equality will be holistically integrated in the mentioned subjects. Teachers' skills will be strengthened both in theoretical knowledge and practical training. Also research articles will be produced. During the recent years, secondary education in Tanzania has been characterised by a growing number of schools and students, and at the same time, by an alarming rate of failure in national Form 4 examinations. In the area of teaching approach, the Ministry of Education of Tanzania has introduced a curriculum change for secondary school subjects, including a shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered participatory approach. The introduction of new syllabuses has not been accompanied by adequate in-service training for the teachers working in the field. This has caused confusion, uncertainty and resistance among the teachers initially trained according to the principles of the traditional teacher-centered approach. PITA Project will be implemented in collaboration between TUMA University Faculty of Education, Meru District Education authorities and selected secondary schools. The project benefits the secondary school teachers and students but on top of that, it offers the academic programmes an opportunity to test and apply participatory and integrative teaching methods in practical grass root level teaching and to develop the teacher training programmes to meet the requirements and challenges of the Tanzanian reality.

Approximately 50% of children remain out of school and many who are enrolled in school drop out or do not attend due to the lack of inclusiveness.  With support from Serve the Ministry of Education (MoE) has just completed their first Inclusive & Child Friendly Education Policy in order to ensure access to and quality of education for all children regardless their gender abilities disabilities backgrounds and circumstances.  The MoE has already begun trainings in Inclusive Education (IE) in several areas in Afghanistan including Nangahar province.SHIP school was established in 1991 to serve the educational needs of deaf children.  The school later expanded to educating children with intellectual disabilities and then recently in 2012 we began our reverse inclusion where the disabled and non-disabled children could be educated together in the same classroom. Many said this would not be possible. However SHIP has proven that it is possible. Serve s goal from its beginning has been to create inclusive communities.  We now believe the community is ready to begin handover of the SHIP school to the MoE as an example of inclusive education.  In order to make this a reality we will work with students parents community and other relevant stakeholders to begin advocacy with the government to take complete responsibility for the education of the students.  We believe this is possible because the government has already taken the responsibility for other special schools.  To accomplish the objective of SHIP handover the following steps will be taken:1. Preparation of MoE schools by implementing Serve Inclusive Education (IE) model2. Preparation of SHIP students for inclusion in the prepared inclusive MoE schools. 3. Preparation of SHIP teachers parents and community for the handover4. Ensure normal and smooth operation of SHIP during the transitional periodWe will gradually release responsibility to the government after they have been trained and equipped with the necessary skills and tools to provide sustainable and quality education for all students.

El Plan de Desarrollo Comunal de Bni Idder considera el impulso de Enseñanza Primaria y la mejora de su calidad como eje prioritario de actuación. El 74.5% de su población es analfabeta (59.8% hombres y 89.2% mujeres). Por ello, presenta índices ligeramente superiores al resto del país y de los más altos de la Provincia de Tetuán. Bni Idder tiene 12 escuelas de Primaria Públicas (3 Agrupaciones escolares): Tlata Bni Idder (343 alumn@s y 14 docentes; 6 h y 8 m), Takat Amer (244 alumn@s y 10 docentes:2 h y 8 m) y Esbab (175 alumn@s y 10 docentes: 5 h y 5 m). Todas ellas carecen de infraestructuras básicas (la existente en estado lamentable); debido al descuido de las autoridades en su mantenimiento. Estas escuelas situadas en douares diseminados en montaña; con acceso muy dificultoso, en época lluviosa. Las escuelas están apartadas de las viviendas (de alumnado y profesorado). Por ejemplo, el personal docente de Tlata Bni Idder se desplaza, diariamente, desde Tetuán en taxi; debido a inexistencia de autobuses directos. Las familias del alumnado son campesinas; y en un 75-85% son analfabetas. Esta dispersión geográfica no favorece la organización del funcionamiento de las escuelas. En la Comuna, únicamente existe una Asociación de padres y madres creada recientemente por el actual director. En general, la población necesita sensibilización para impulsar el acceso y la continuidad escolar. Las carencias materiales, formativas, institucionales y sociales existentes provocan un desinterés y desmotivación en el personal docente. Con este proyecto, se pretende mejorar las capacidades humanas y el sistema educativo en la Primaria de l@s niñ@s de Bni Idder a través de acciones relacionadas con: a) construcción/rehabilitación y dotación de infraestructuras básicas a 3 Escuelas, b) talleres de Alfabetización y sensibilización sobre la importancia de la educación para desarrollo integral, empoderamiento y el compromiso de las partes implicadas (Instituciones Educativas, Comuna, Directores y personal docente, padres/madres, menores, douares) para mejorar la calidad educativa en el medio rural (reducción absentismo y abandono escolar, calidad en los contenidos y nivel de enseñanza), c) talleres y reuniones para activar/dinamizar/fortalecer las asociaciones de padres y madres (AMPAS) que se conviertan en garantes y defensores de los derechos de sus hijos a la educación especialmente al acceso con calidad de la misma.",Principal gender component,Not screened,"",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,Not employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"education, family, advocacy"

Indeed, improper wiring of the nervous system has been suggested to be the basis for some neurodevelopmental defects. What are the mechanisms that guarantee the proper wiring between the billions of neurons during brain development? Axons are guided to their targets by molecules in the extracellular environment called 'guidance cues.' These cues can be either attractive, pulling axons in the right direction; or repulsive, preventing axons from navigating to incorrect targets. Other conditions in which axons need to navigate in adults are regeneration after mechanical or degenerative stimuli, as after spinal cord injury. Proper regeneration in adult mammals is still a significant clinical problem. Overall, this work will shed new light on the mechanisms that govern the wiring of the nervous system and their role in axon regeneration It could help to identify novel strategies to promote the proper guidance and wiring into neural circuits of abnormally developing axons or damaged and regenerating axons.The project is led in Canada by Frédéric Charron, Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) at the University of Montreal and his collaborators are Avraham Yaron, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, and Felipe A Court at University of Chile, Chile.This work is funded through the first research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Initiative.

However, CP is a common cause of movement disability and it has a devastating impact on the child and its family affecting occupational activities, social relationships, psychological well-being and financial conditions. We plan to perform a randomized controlled study comparing clusters of villages with the community based program to villages maintaining the ordinary health services. However, before commencing the intervention we need to understand the panorama of CP in Uganda. There is little information available about the epidemiology of CP in Sub-Saharan Africa. We are currently studying a hospital cohort at Mulago University Hospital in Kampala, but there are obvious limitations. Therefore, we plan to perform a population-based epidemiology study on CP at the Iganga DSS, in which we will explore the prevalence, type of CP, severity level, associated risk factors as well as available rehabilitative and therapeutic services.

Health, General",Medical services,Services for Palestinian children with multiple special needs and their families in Lebanon II (MSN-project),SERVICES FOR PALESTINIAN CHILDREN WITH MULTIPLE SPECIAL NEEDS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN LEBANON II (MSN-PROJECT),The aim of the project is to promote the availability of health and educational services for Palestinian disabled children (Rights of Persons with Disabilities Article 24) The National Institution of Social Care and Vocational Training (NISCVT) started the sponsorship program to support the children with multiple special needs (from now on referred to as MSN children) with tuition fees for special schools in 2009. In 2013-15 the focus has been on opening the way for Palestinian MSN children living in Lebanon and displaced from Syria to the special services. After a difficult start the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) of NISCVT have succeeded to obtain special education places in 16 institutions. A study on the MSN children (n=49) attending the special schools in 2013-2014 showed that clinically four of five children progressed at least moderately. Nearly all parents were satisfied and the schools stated that the children?s study motivation parents' involvement and children?s progress was good (75 %). In addition to the core activity the project has increased skills of the staff by training developed family-approach social work and encouraged the families to go out with their MSN child in order to get in contact with the community. Thus the project successfully mitigates disability-based discrimination. Services for boys and girls are equal although there are more boys than girls in the project due to the higher prevalence of disability rate in male than in female populations.Only a fraction of the Palestinian MSN children get rehabilitation and special education services in Lebanon and among the children displaced from Syria the situation is even worse. The project will continue mainly as in the previous years: FGCs offer assessment treatment referral to services additional treatments in FGCs and support to the families. The follow up project will focus more on initial rehabilitation assessment medical tests and medication. Places in special schools will be arranged for 60-80 MSN children (depending on the cost level). Activities with parents (100-160) and siblings (200-250) aim to make the daily environment of the MSN child more stimulating and encourage the family members to share the responsibilities for the care.The NISCVT FGSs will be developed by staff training service studies and the ?beneficiaries as project evaluators? model into resource centers that provide information and  support for working with the MSN children.,Significant gender component,Not screened,"Finnish NGO, Finnish Psychologists for Social Reponsibility",Donor country-based NGO,22000,22000,Significant,potential false positive,inclusion,employment,intellectual,education,family,advocacy,Mixed,"employment, education, family, advocacy"

Il est aussi nécessaire d'informer la population à travers des campagnes massives (spots télévisés/ brochures) mais aussi de préparer le personnel médical qui, centré sur la survie de la mère et du nouveau -né, ne mesure pas toujours les conséquences de certaines pratiques sur les conditions de vie de ces personnes dans le futur, ou minimise certains facteurs de risque.
